0,0,17,9,141,"A Survey of Linguistic Structures for Application-level Fault Tolerance Structures for the expression of fault-tolerance provisions in application software comprise the central topic of this article. Structuring techniques answer questions as to how to incorporate fault tolerance in the application layer of a computer program and how to manage the fault-tolerant code. As such, they provide the means to control complexity, the latter being a relevant factor for the introduction of design faults. This fact and the ever-increasing complexity of today's distributed software justify the need for simple, coherent, and effective structures for the expression of fault-tolerance in the application software. In this text we first define a ``base'' of structural attributes with which application-level fault-tolerance structures can be qualitatively assessed and compared with each other and with respect to the aforementioned needs. This result is then used to provide an elaborated survey of the state-of-the-art of application-level fault-tolerance structures.

1,0,10,8,113,"Process-centered Review of Object Oriented Software Development Methodologies We provide a detailed review of existing object-oriented software development methodologies, focusing on their development processes. The review aims at laying bare their core philosophies, processes, and internal activities.

2,0,6,7,209,"Implicit Array Bounds Checking on 64-bit Architectures Several programming languages guarantee that array subscripts are checked to ensure they are within the bounds of the array. While this guarantee improves the correctness and security of array-based code, it adds overhead to array references. This has been an obstacle to using higher-level languages, such as Java, for high-performance parallel computing, where the language specification requires that all array accesses must be checked to ensure they are within bounds. This is because, in practice, array-bounds checking in scientific applications may increase execution time by more than a factor of 2. Previous research has explored optimizations to statically eliminate bounds checks, but the dynamic nature of many scientific codes makes this difficult or impossible. Our approach is, instead, to create a compiler and operating system infrastructure that does not generate explicit bounds checks. It instead places arrays inside of Index Confinement Regions (ICRs), which are large, isolated, mostly unmapped virtual memory regions. Any array reference outside of its bounds will cause a protection violation; this provides implicit bounds checking. Our results show that when applying this infrastructure to high-performance computing programs written in Java, the overhead of bounds checking relative to a program with no bounds checks is reduced from an average of 63% to an average of 9%. 64-bit architectures, Array-bounds checking, virtual memory",implicit array bounds checking on 64 bit architectures several programming languages guarantee that array subscripts are checked to ensure they are within the bounds of the array while this guarantee improves the correctness and security of array based code it adds overhead to array references this has been an obstacle to using higher level languages such as java for high performance parallel computing where the language specification requires that all array accesses must be checked to ensure they are within bounds this is because in practice array bounds checking in scientific applications may increase execution time by more than a factor of 2 previous research has explored optimizations to statically eliminate bounds checks but the dynamic nature of many scientific codes makes this difficult or impossible our approach is instead to create a compiler and operating system infrastructure that does not generate explicit bounds checks it instead places arrays inside of index confinement regions icrs which are large isolated mostly unmapped virtual memory regions any array reference outside of its bounds will cause a protection violation this provides implicit bounds checking our results show that when applying this infrastructure to high performance computing programs written in java the overhead of bounds checking relative to a program with no bounds checks is reduced from an average of 63 to an average of 9 64 bit architectures array bounds checking virtual memory,230,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
3,0,6,5,311,"Interaction Cost and Shotgun Profiling We observe that the challenges software optimizers and microarchitects face every day boil down to a single problem: bottleneck analysis. A bottleneck is any event or resource that contributes to execution time, such as a critical cache miss or window stall. Tasks such as tuning processors for energy efficiency and finding the right loads to prefetch all require measuring the performance costs of bottlenecks.In the past, simple event counts were enough to find the important bottlenecks. Today, the parallelism of modern processors makes such analysis much more difficult, rendering traditional performance counters less useful. If two microarchitectural events (such as a fetch stall and a cache miss) occur in the same cycle, which event should we blame for the cycle? What cost should we assign to each event? In this paper, we introduce a new model for understanding event costs to facilitate processor design and optimization.First, we observe that all instructions, hardware structures, and events in a machine can interact in only one of two ways (in parallel or serially). We quantify these interactions by defining interaction cost, which can be zero (independent, no interaction), positive (parallel), or negative (serial).Second, we illustrate the value of using interaction costs in processor design and optimization. In a processor with a long pipeline, we show how to mitigate the negative performance effect of long latency ""critical"" loops, such as the level-one cache access and issue-wakeup, by optimizing seemingly unrelated resources that interact with them.Finally, we propose shotgun profiling, a class of hardware profiling infrastructures that are parallelism-aware, in contrast to traditional event counters. Our recommended design requires only modest extensions to current hardware counters, while enabling the construction of full-featured dependence graphs of the microexecution. With these dependence graphs, many types of analyses can be performed, including identifying critical instructions, finding slack, as well as computing costs and interaction costs.

4,0,8,10,241,"DeFT: Design Space Exploration for On-the-fly Detection of Coherence Misses While multicore processors promise large performance benefits for parallel applications, writing these applications is notoriously difficult. Tuning a parallel application to achieve good performance, also known as performance debugging, is often more challenging than debugging the application for correctness. Parallel programs have many performance-related issues that are not seen in sequential programs. An increase in cache misses is one of the biggest challenges that programmers face. To minimize these misses, programmers must not only identify the source of the extra misses, but also perform the tricky task of determining if the misses are caused by interthread communication (i.e., coherence misses) and if so, whether they are caused by true or false sharing (since the solutions for these two are quite different). In this article, we propose a new programmer-centric definition of false sharing misses and describe our novel algorithm to perform coherence miss classification. We contrast our approach with existing data-centric definitions of false sharing. A straightforward implementation of our algorithm is too expensive to be incorporated in real hardware. Therefore, we explore the design space for low-cost hardware support that can classify coherence misses on-the-fly into true and false sharing misses, allowing existing performance counters and profiling tools to expose and attribute them. We find that our approximate schemes achieve good accuracy at only a fraction of the cost of the ideal scheme. Additionally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our work in a case study involving a real application. Performance debugging, coherence misses, false sharing, multicore processors",deft design space exploration for on the fly detection of coherence misses while multicore processors promise large performance benefits for parallel applications writing these applications is notoriously difficult tuning a parallel application to achieve good performance also known as performance debugging is often more challenging than debugging the application for correctness parallel programs have many performance related issues that are not seen in sequential programs an increase in cache misses is one of the biggest challenges that programmers face to minimize these misses programmers must not only identify the source of the extra misses but also perform the tricky task of determining if the misses are caused by interthread communication i e coherence misses and if so whether they are caused by true or false sharing since the solutions for these two are quite different in this article we propose a new programmer centric definition of false sharing misses and describe our novel algorithm to perform coherence miss classification we contrast our approach with existing data centric definitions of false sharing a straightforward implementation of our algorithm is too expensive to be incorporated in real hardware therefore we explore the design space for low cost hardware support that can classify coherence misses on the fly into true and false sharing misses allowing existing performance counters and profiling tools to expose and attribute them we find that our approximate schemes achieve good accuracy at only a fraction of the cost of the ideal scheme additionally we demonstrate the usefulness of our work in a case study involving a real application performance debugging coherence misses false sharing multicore processors,267,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
5,0,5,8,242,"Improving WCET by Applying a WC Code-positioning Optimization Applications in embedded systems often need to meet specified timing constraints. It is advantageous to not only calculate the worst-case execution time (WCET) of an application, but to also perform transformation, which reduce the WCET, since an application with a lower WCET will be less likely to violate its timing constraints. Some processors incur a pipeline delay whenever an instruction transfers control to a target that is not the next sequential instruction. Code-positioning optimizations attempt to reduce these delays by positioning the basic blocks to minimize the number of unconditional jumps and taken conditional branches that occur. Traditional code-positioning algorithms use profile data to find the frequently executed edges between basic blocks, then minimize the transfers of control along these edges to reduce the average case execution time (ACET). This paper introduces a WCET code-positioning optimization, driven by the worst-case (WC) path information from a timing analyzer, to reduce the WCET instead of ACET. This WCET optimization changes the layout of the code in memory to reduce the branch penalties along the WC paths. Unlike the frequency of edges in traditional profile-driven code positioning, the WC path may change after code-positioning decisions are made. Thus, WCET code positioning is inherently more challenging than ACET code positioning. The experimental results show that this optimization typically finds the optimal layout of the basic blocks with the minimal WCET. The results show over a 7% reduction in WCET is achieved after code positioning is performed.

6,0,9,8,140,"Fast, Accurate Event Classification on Resource-Lean Embedded Sensors Due to the limited computational and energy resources available on existing wireless sensor platforms, achieving high-precision classification of high-level events in-network is a challenge. In this article, we present in-network implementations of a Bayesian classifier and a condensed kd-tree classifier for identifying events of interest on resource-lean embedded sensors. The first approach uses preprocessed sensor readings to derive a multidimensional Bayesian classifier used to classify sensor data in real time. The second introduces an innovative condensed kd-tree to represent preprocessed sensor data and uses a fast nearest-neighbor search to determine the likelihood of class membership for incoming samples. Both classifiers consume limited resources and provide high-precision classification. To evaluate each approach, two case studies are considered, in the contexts of human movement and vehicle navigation, respectively. The classification accuracy is above 85% for both classifiers across the two case studies.

7,0,4,7,169,"Agile Dynamic Provisioning of Multi-tier Internet Applications Dynamic capacity provisioning is a useful technique for handling the multi-time-scale variations seen in Internet workloads. In this article, we propose a novel dynamic provisioning technique for multi-tier Internet applications that employs (1) a flexible queuing model to determine how much of the resources to allocate to each tier of the application, and (2) a combination of predictive and reactive methods that determine when to provision these resources, both at large and small time scales. We propose a novel data center architecture based on virtual machine monitors to reduce provisioning overheads. Our experiments on a forty-machine Xen/Linux-based hosting platform demonstrate the responsiveness of our technique in handling dynamic workloads. In one scenario where a flash crowd caused the workload of a three-tier application to double, our technique was able to double the application capacity within five minutes, thus maintaining response-time targets. Our technique also reduced the overhead of switching servers across applications from several minutes to less than a second, while meeting the performance targets of residual sessions. Internet application, dynamic provisioning",agile dynamic provisioning of multi tier internet applications dynamic capacity provisioning is a useful technique for handling the multi time scale variations seen in internet workloads in this article we propose a novel dynamic provisioning technique for multi tier internet applications that employs 1 a flexible queuing model to determine how much of the resources to allocate to each tier of the application and 2 a combination of predictive and reactive methods that determine when to provision these resources both at large and small time scales we propose a novel data center architecture based on virtual machine monitors to reduce provisioning overheads our experiments on a forty machine xen linux based hosting platform demonstrate the responsiveness of our technique in handling dynamic workloads in one scenario where a flash crowd caused the workload of a three tier application to double our technique was able to double the application capacity within five minutes thus maintaining response time targets our technique also reduced the overhead of switching servers across applications from several minutes to less than a second while meeting the performance targets of residual sessions internet application dynamic provisioning,188,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
8,0,9,7,179,"A Systematic Survey of Self-Protecting Software Systems Self-protecting software systems are a class of autonomic systems capable of detecting and mitigating security threats at runtime. They are growing in importance, as the stovepipe static methods of securing software systems have been shown to be inadequate for the challenges posed by modern software systems. Self-protection, like other self-* properties, allows the system to adapt to the changing environment through autonomic means without much human intervention, and can thereby be responsive, agile, and cost effective. While existing research has made significant progress towards autonomic and adaptive security, gaps and challenges remain. This article presents a significant extension of our preliminary study in this area. In particular, unlike our preliminary study, here we have followed a systematic literature review process, which has broadened the scope of our study and strengthened the validity of our conclusions. By proposing and applying a comprehensive taxonomy to classify and characterize the state-of-the-art research in this area, we have identified key patterns, trends and challenges in the existing approaches, which reveals a number of opportunities that will shape the focus of future research efforts.

9,0,8,7,280,"Improving the Reliability of Commodity Operating Systems Despite decades of research in extensible operating system technology, extensions such as device drivers remain a significant cause of system failures. In Windows XP, for example, drivers account for 85% of recently reported failures.This article describes Nooks, a reliability subsystem that seeks to greatly enhance operating system (OS) reliability by isolating the OS from driver failures. The Nooks approach is practical: rather than guaranteeing complete fault tolerance through a new (and incompatible) OS or driver architecture, our goal is to prevent the vast majority of driver-caused crashes with little or no change to the existing driver and system code. Nooks isolates drivers within lightweight protection domains inside the kernel address space, where hardware and software prevent them from corrupting the kernel. Nooks also tracks a driver's use of kernel resources to facilitate automatic cleanup during recovery.To prove the viability of our approach, we implemented Nooks in the Linux operating system and used it to fault-isolate several device drivers. Our results show that Nooks offers a substantial increase in the reliability of operating systems, catching and quickly recovering from many faults that would otherwise crash the system. Under a wide range and number of fault conditions, we show that Nooks recovers automatically from 99% of the faults that otherwise cause Linux to crash.While Nooks was designed for drivers, our techniques generalize to other kernel extensions. We demonstrate this by isolating a kernel-mode file system and an in-kernel Internet service. Overall, because Nooks supports existing C-language extensions, runs on a commodity operating system and hardware, and enables automated recovery, it represents a substantial step beyond the specialized architectures and type-safe languages required by previous efforts directed at safe extensibility.

10,0,14,15,203,"An Empirical Study of the &Ldquo;Prototype Walkthrough&Rdquo;: A Studio-Based Activity for HCI Education For over a century, studio-based instruction has served as an effective pedagogical model in architecture and fine arts education. Because of its design orientation, human-computer interaction (HCI) education is an excellent venue for studio-based instruction. In an HCI course, we have been exploring a studio-based learning activity called the prototype walkthrough, in which a student project team simulates its evolving user interface prototype while a student audience member acts as a test user. The audience is encouraged to ask questions and provide feedback. We have observed that prototype walkthroughs create excellent conditions for learning about user interface design. In order to better understand the educational value of the activity, we performed a content analysis of a video corpus of 16 prototype walkthroughs held in two HCI courses. We found that the prototype walkthrough discussions were dominated by relevant design issues.

11,0,16,2,288,"Warp Processors We describe a new processing architecture, known as a warp processor, that utilizes a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to improve the speed and energy consumption of a software binary executing on a microprocessor. Unlike previous approaches that also improve software using an FPGA but do so using a special compiler, a warp processor achieves these improvements completely transparently and operates from a standard binary. A warp processor dynamically detects the binary's critical regions, reimplements those regions as a custom hardware circuit in the FPGA, and replaces the software region by a call to the new hardware implementation of that region. While not all benchmarks can be improved using warp processing, many can, and the improvements are dramatically better than those achievable by more traditional architecture improvements. The hardest part of warp processing is that of dynamically reimplementing code regions on an FPGA, requiring partitioning, decompilation, synthesis, placement, and routing tools, all having to execute with minimal computation time and data memory so as to coexist on chip with the main processor. We describe the results of developing our warp processor. We developed a custom FPGA fabric specifically designed to enable lean place and route tools, and we developed extremely fast and efficient versions of partitioning, decompilation, synthesis, technology mapping, placement, and routing. Warp processors achieve overall application speedups of 6.3X with energy savings of 66% across a set of embedded benchmark applications. We further show that our tools utilize acceptably small amounts of computation and memory which are far less than traditional tools. Our work illustrates the feasibility and potential of warp processing, and we can foresee the possibility of warp processing becoming a feature in a variety of computing domains, including desktop, server, and embedded applications.

13,0,11,10,178,"Low-power TinyOS Tuned Processor Platform for Wireless Sensor Network Motes In this article we describe a low-power processor platform for use in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes (motes). WSN motes are small, battery-powered devices comprised of a processor, sensors, and a radio frequency transceiver. It is expected that WSNs consisting of large numbers of motes will offer long-term, distributed monitoring, and control of real-world equipment and phenomena. A key requirement for these applications is long battery life. We investigate a processor platform architecture based on an application-specific programmable processor core, System-On-Chip bus, and a hardware accelerator. The architecture improves on the energy consumption of a conventional microprocessor design by tuning the architecture for a suite of TinyOS-based WSN applications. The tuning method used minimizes changes to the instruction set architecture facilitating rapid software migration to the new platform.

16,0,16,13,344,"Ten Years of Building Broken Chips: The Physics and Engineering of Inexact Computing Well over a decade ago, many believed that an engine of growth driving the semiconductor and computing industries---captured nicely by Gordon Moore's remarkable prophecy (Moore's law)---was speeding towards a dangerous cliff-edge. Ranging from expressions of concern to doomsday scenarios, the exact time when serious hurdles would beset us varied quite a bit---some of the more optimistic warnings giving Moore's law until. Needless to say, a lot of people have spent time and effort with great success to find ways for substantially extending the time when we would encounter the dreaded cliff-edge, if not avoiding it altogether. Faced with this issue, we started approaching this in a decidedly different manner---one which suggested falling off the metaphorical cliff as a design choice, but in a controlled way. This resulted in devices that could switch and produce bits that are correct, namely of having the intended value, only with a probabilistic guarantee. As a result, the results could in fact be incorrect. Such devices and associated circuits and computing structures are now broadly referred to as inexact designs, circuits, and architectures. In this article, we will crystallize the essence of inexactness dating back to 2002 through two key principles that we developed: (i) that of admitting error in a design in return for resource savings, and subsequently (ii) making resource investments in the elements of a hardware platform proportional to the value of information they compute. We will also give a broad overview of a range of inexact designs and hardware concepts that our group and other groups around the world have been developing since, based on these two principles. Despite not being deterministically precise, inexact designs can be significantly more efficient in the energy they consume, their speed of execution, and their area needs, which makes them attractive in application contexts that are resilient to error. Significantly, our development of inexactness will be contrasted against the rich backdrop of traditional approaches aimed at realizing reliable computing from unreliable elements, starting with von Neumann's influential lectures and further developed by Shannon-Weaver and others.

17,0,7,9,163,"Designing Best Effort Networks-on-chip to Meet Hard Latency Constraints Many classes of applications require Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees from the system interconnect. In Networks-on-Chip (NoC) QoS guarantees usually translate into bandwidth and latency constraints for the traffic flows and require hardware support in the NoC fabric and its interfaces. In this article we present a novel NoC synthesis framework to automatically build networks that meet hard latency constraints of end-to-end traffic streams without requiring specialized hardware for the network components. The hard latency constraints are met by carefully designing the NoC topology and selecting the appropriate routes for flow using lean best-effort network components. We perform experiments on several System on Chip (SoC) benchmarks. We compared against a topology synthesis method with no support for real-time constraints and we show that the proposed method can produce topologies that can meet significantly tighter worst case latency constraints (on average 44%). We also show that the tightest worst case latency can be provided with little overhead on power consumption (on average 8.5%).

18,0,10,9,364,"Hardware Architectural Support for Control Systems and Sensor Processing The field of modern control theory and the systems used to implement these controls have shown rapid development over the last 50 years. It was often the case that those developing control algorithms could assume the computing medium was solely dedicated to the task of controlling a plant, for example, the control algorithm being implemented in software on a dedicated Digital Signal Processor (DSP), or implemented in hardware using a simple dedicated Programmable Logic Device (PLD). As time progressed, the drive to place more system functionality in a single component (reducing power, cost, and increasing reliability) has made this assumption less often true. Thus, it has been pointed out by some experts in the field of control theory (e.g., Astrom) that those developing control algorithms must take into account the effects of running their algorithms on systems that will be shared with other tasks. One aspect of the work presented in this article is a hardware architecture that allows control developers to maintain this simplifying assumption. We focus specifically on the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. An on-chip coprocessor has been implemented that can scale to support servicing hundreds of plants, while maintaining microsecond-level response times, tight deterministic control loop timing, and allowing the main processor to service noncontrol tasks. In order to control a plant, the controller needs information about the plant's state. Typically this information is obtained from sensors with which the plant has been instrumented. There are a number of common computations that may be performed on this sensor data before being presented to the controller (e.g., averaging and thresholding). Thus in addition to supporting PID algorithms, we have developed a Sensor Processing Unit (SPU) that off-loads these common sensor processing tasks from the main processor. We have prototyped our ideas using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. Through our experimental results, we show our PID execution unit gives orders of magnitude improvement in response time when servicing many plants, as compared to a standard general software implementation. We also show that the SPU scales much better than a general software implementation. In addition, these execution units allow the simplifying assumption of dedicated computing medium to hold for control algorithm development.

19,0,11,9,175,"The Irregular Z-buffer: Hardware Acceleration for Irregular Data Structures The classical Z-buffer visibility algorithm samples a scene at regularly spaced points on an image plane. Previously, we introduced an extension of this algorithm called the irregular Z-buffer that permits sampling of the scene from arbitrary points on the image plane. These sample points are stored in a two-dimensional spatial data structure. Here we present a set of architectural enhancements to the classical Z-buffer acceleration hardware which supports efficient execution of the irregular Z-buffer. These enhancements enable efficient parallel construction and query of certain irregular data structures, including the grid of linked lists used by our algorithm. The enhancements include flexible atomic read-modify-write units located near the memory controller, an internal routing network between these units and the fragment processors, and a MIMD fragment processor design.

20,0,10,9,172,"Polarization Fields: Dynamic Light Field Display Using Multi-layer LCDs We introduce polarization field displays as an optically-efficient design for dynamic light field display using multi-layered LCDs. Such displays consist of a stacked set of liquid crystal panels with a single pair of crossed linear polarizers. Each layer is modeled as a spatially-controllable polarization rotator, as opposed to a conventional spatial light modulator that directly attenuates light. Color display is achieved using field sequential color illumination with monochromatic LCDs, mitigating severe attenuation and moiré occurring with layered color filter arrays. We demonstrate such displays can be controlled, at interactive refresh rates, by adopting the SART algorithm to tomographically solve for the optimal spatially-varying polarization state rotations applied by each layer. We validate our design by constructing a prototype using modified off-the-shelf panels. We demonstrate interactive display using a GPU-based SART implementation supporting both polarization-based and attenuation-based architectures. Experiments characterize the accuracy of our image formation model, verifying polarization field displays achieve increased brightness, higher resolution, and extended depth of field, as compared to existing automultiscopic display methods for dual-layer and multi-layer LCDs. automultiscopic 3D displays, computational displays, light fields, multi-layer LCDs, tomography",polarization fields dynamic light field display using multi layer lcds we introduce polarization field displays as an optically efficient design for dynamic light field display using multi layered lcds such displays consist of a stacked set of liquid crystal panels with a single pair of crossed linear polarizers each layer is modeled as a spatially controllable polarization rotator as opposed to a conventional spatial light modulator that directly attenuates light color display is achieved using field sequential color illumination with monochromatic lcds mitigating severe attenuation and moir occurring with layered color filter arrays we demonstrate such displays can be controlled at interactive refresh rates by adopting the sart algorithm to tomographically solve for the optimal spatially varying polarization state rotations applied by each layer we validate our design by constructing a prototype using modified off the shelf panels we demonstrate interactive display using a gpu based sart implementation supporting both polarization based and attenuation based architectures experiments characterize the accuracy of our image formation model verifying polarization field displays achieve increased brightness higher resolution and extended depth of field as compared to existing automultiscopic display methods for dual layer and multi layer lcds automultiscopic 3d displays computational displays light fields multi layer lcds tomography,204,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

22,0,10,12,179,"The Impact of SOA Implementation on IT-Business Alignment: A System Dynamics Approach With firms facing intense rivalry, globalization, and time-to-market pressures, the need for organizational agility assumes greater importance. One of the primary vehicles for achieving organizational agility is the use of agile information systems [IS] and the close alignment of information technologies [IT] with business. However, IS is often viewed as an impediment to organization agility. Recently, service-oriented architecture [SOA] has emerged as a prominent IS agility-enhancing technology. The fundamental question of how SOA can enhance organization agility and foster closer alignment between IT and business has not been adequately addressed. The dynamic interaction among external business environmental factors, organizational agility, and IS architecture makes the process of keeping IT and business aligned more complex. This study uses a design science approach to build a system dynamics model to examine the effect of employing alternative SOA implementation strategies in various organizational and external business environments on the IT business alignment and IS cost. The results provide insights into the shaping of IT-business alignment. Additionally, the system dynamics model serves as a tool for supporting managerial decisions related to SOA implementation.

In our work, we provide testament to the impressive capacity of recent FPGAs by hosting a complete Pentium® in a single FPGA chip. In addition we demonstrate how FPGAs can be used for microprocessor design space exploration while overcoming the tension between simulation speed, model accuracy, and model completeness found in traditional software simulator environments. Specifically, we perform preliminary experimentation/prototyping with an original Socket 7 based desktop processor system with typical hardware peripherals running modern operating systems such as Fedora Core 4 and Windows XP; however we have inserted a Xilinx Virtex-4 in place of the processor that should sit in the motherboard and have used the Virtex-4 to host a complete version of the Pentium® microprocessor (which consumes less than half its resources). We can therefore apply architectural changes to the processor and evaluate their effects on the complete desktop system. We use this FPGA-based emulation system to conduct preliminary architectural experiments including growing the branch target buffer and the level 1 caches. In addition, we experimented with interfacing hardware accelerators such as DES and AES engines which resulted in a 27x speedup.

25,0,12,13,199,"ReShape: Towards a High-Level Approach to Design and Operation of Modular Reconfigurable Systems The latest FPGA devices provide the headroom to implement large-scale and complex systems. A key requirement is the integration of modules from diverse sources to promote modular design and reuse. A contrary factor is that using dynamic partial reconfiguration typically requires low-level planning of the system implementation. In this article, we introduce ReShape: a high-level approach for designing reconfigurable systems by interconnecting modules, which gives a ``plug and play'' look and feel, is supported by tools that carry out implementation functions, and is carried through to support system reconfiguration during operation. The emphasis is on the inter-module connections and abstracting the communication patterns that are typical between modules: for example, the streaming of data, or the reading and writing of data to and from memory modules. The details of wiring and signaling are hidden from view, via metadata associated with individual modules. This setting allows system reconfiguration at the module level, both by supporting type checking of replacement modules and by managing the overall system implementation, via metadata associated with its FPGA floorplan. The methodology and tools have been implemented in a prototype targeted to a domain-specific setting---high-speed networking---and have been validated on real telecommunications design projects.

26,0,11,7,176,"Vector Processing As a Soft Processor Accelerator Current FPGA soft processor systems use dedicated hardware modules or accelerators to speed up data-parallel applications. This work explores an alternative approach of using a soft vector processor as a general-purpose accelerator. The approach has the benefits of a purely software-oriented development model, a fixed ISA allowing parallel software and hardware development, a single accelerator that can accelerate multiple applications, and scalable performance from the same source code. With no hardware design experience needed, a software programmer can make area-versus-performance trade-offs by scaling the number of functional units and register file bandwidth with a single parameter. A soft vector processor can be further customized by a number of secondary parameters to add or remove features for a specific application to optimize resource utilization. This article introduces VIPERS, a soft vector processor architecture that maps efficiently into an FPGA and provides a scalable amount of performance for a reasonable amount of area. Compared to a Nios II/s processor, instances of VIPERS with 32 processing lanes achieve up to 44× speedup using up to 26× the area.

27,0,10,8,223,"Energy-efficient Localization: GPS Duty Cycling with Radio Ranging GPS is a commonly used and convenient technology for determining absolute position in outdoor environments, but its high power consumption leads to rapid battery depletion in mobile devices. An obvious solution is to duty cycle the GPS module, which prolongs the device lifetime at the cost of increased position uncertainty while the GPS is off. This article addresses the trade-off between energy consumption and localization performance in a mobile sensor network application. The focus is on augmenting GPS location with more energy-efficient location sensors to bound position estimate uncertainty while GPS is off. Empirical GPS and radio contact data from a large-scale animal tracking deployment is used to model node mobility, radio performance, and GPS. Because GPS takes a considerable, and variable, time after powering up before it delivers a good position measurement, we model the GPS behavior through empirical measurements of two GPS modules. These models are then used to explore duty cycling strategies for maintaining position uncertainty within specified bounds. We then explore the benefits of using short-range radio contact logging alongside GPS as an energy-inexpensive means of lowering uncertainty while the GPS is off, and we propose strategies that use RSSI ranging and GPS back-offs to further reduce energy consumption. Results show that our combined strategies can cut node energy consumption by one third while still meeting application-specific positioning criteria.

28,0,12,7,146,"Reliable and Efficient Reprogramming in Sensor Networks Retasking and remote programming of sensor networks is an essential functionality to make these networks practical and effective. As the availability of more capable sensor nodes increases and new functional implementations continue to be proposed, these large collections of wireless nodes will need the ability to update and upgrade the software packages they are running. In order to do this, the new binary file must be distributed to all nodes in the network. Making a physical connection with each individual node is impractical in large wireless networks. Standard flooding mechanisms are too energy-costly and computationally expensive and they may interfere with the network's current tasks. A reliable method for distributing new code or binary files to every node in a wireless sensor network is needed. We propose a reprogramming/retasking framework for sensor networks that is energy efficient, responsive, and reliable, while maintaining a stable network.

29,0,12,6,161,"Elliptical Anomalies in Wireless Sensor Networks Anomalies in wireless sensor networks can occur due to malicious attacks, faulty sensors, changes in the observed external phenomena, or errors in communication. Defining and detecting these interesting events in energy-constrained situations is an important task in managing these types of networks. A key challenge is how to detect anomalies with few false alarms while preserving the limited energy in the network. In this article, we define different types of anomalies that occur in wireless sensor networks and provide formal models for them. We illustrate the model using statistical parameters on a dataset gathered from a real wireless sensor network deployment at the Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory. Our experiments with a novel distributed anomaly detection algorithm show that it can detect elliptical anomalies with exactly the same accuracy as that of a centralized scheme, while achieving a significant reduction in energy consumption in the network. Finally, we demonstrate that our model compares favorably to four other well-known schemes on four datasets.

31,0,13,6,184,"Developing Multiagent Systems: The Gaia Methodology Systems composed of interacting autonomous agents offer a promising software engineering approach for developing applications in complex domains. However, this multiagent system paradigm introduces a number of new abstractions and design/development issues when compared with more traditional approaches to software development. Accordingly, new analysis and design methodologies, as well as new tools, are needed to effectively engineer such systems. Against this background, the contribution of this article is twofold. First, we synthesize and clarify the key abstractions of agent-based computing as they pertain to agent-oriented software engineering. In particular, we argue that a multiagent system can naturally be viewed and architected as a computational organization, and we identify the appropriate organizational abstractions that are central to the analysis and design of such systems. Second, we detail and extend the Gaia methodology for the analysis and design of multiagent systems. Gaia exploits the aforementioned organizational abstractions to provide clear guidelines for the analysis and design of complex and open software systems. Two representative case studies are introduced to exemplify Gaia's concepts and to show its use and effectiveness in different types of multiagent system.

32,0,9,9,280,"Designing and Implementing the OP and OP2 Web Browsers Current web browsers are plagued with vulnerabilities, providing hackers with easy access to computer systems via browser-based attacks. Browser security efforts that retrofit existing browsers have had limited success because the design of modern browsers is fundamentally flawed. To enable more secure web browsing, we design and implement a new browser, called the OP web browser, that attempts to improve the state-of-the-art in browser security. We combine operating system design principles with formal methods to design a more secure web browser by drawing on the expertise of both communities. Our design philosophy is to partition the browser into smaller subsystems and make all communication between subsystems simple and explicit. At the core of our design is a small browser kernel that manages the browser subsystems and interposes on all communications between them to enforce our new browser security features. To show the utility of our browser architecture, we design and implement three novel security features. First, we develop flexible security policies that allow us to include browser plugins within our security framework. Second, we use formal methods to prove useful security properties including user interface invariants and browser security policy. Third, we design and implement a browser-level information-flow tracking system to enable post-mortem analysis of browser-based attacks. In addition to presenting the OP browser architecture, we discuss the design and implementation of a second version of OP, OP2, that includes features from other secure web browser designs to improve on the overall security and performance of OP. To evaluate our design, we implemented OP2 and tested both performance, memory, and filesystem impact while browsing popular pages. We show that the additional security features in OP and OP2 introduce minimal overhead.

34,0,8,5,216,"Performance of a Micro-threaded Pipeline The micro-threaded microprocessor is a chip multi-processor, which uses a multi-threaded approach, where the threads are obtained from within a single context and exploit both vector and instruction level parallelism (ILP). This approach employs vertical and horizontal transfer in a simple pipeline. The horizontal transfer is referred to as the normal scalar pipeline processing used in most microprocessors. Vertical transfer is a context switch, which allows the code to tolerate any latency from undetermined data and control dependencies. The performance of the single pipeline is very important in the overall performance of the whole processor, which can distribute threads to any of the available processors. We have measured the influence of three crucial parameters - cache delay, cache miss rate, and number of registers - on the performance using our simulator. Even for a long cache delay (1000 processor cycles) we found that the micro-threaded pipeline can still achieves an IPC of 0.8 in the peak performance which is some 6 times better than a conventional scalar pipeline. If we further degrade cache performance by using an artificially small cache line size the performance of conventional scalar pipeline gives an IPC of 0.02, whereas with unlimited registers the micro-threaded pipeline still manages to achieve and IPC of 0.8 (a factor of 40 difference in performance). micro thread, micro-threaded pipeline, performance evaluation, scalar pipeline",performance of a micro threaded pipeline the micro threaded microprocessor is a chip multi processor which uses a multi threaded approach where the threads are obtained from within a single context and exploit both vector and instruction level parallelism ilp this approach employs vertical and horizontal transfer in a simple pipeline the horizontal transfer is referred to as the normal scalar pipeline processing used in most microprocessors vertical transfer is a context switch which allows the code to tolerate any latency from undetermined data and control dependencies the performance of the single pipeline is very important in the overall performance of the whole processor which can distribute threads to any of the available processors we have measured the influence of three crucial parameters cache delay cache miss rate and number of registers on the performance using our simulator even for a long cache delay 1000 processor cycles we found that the micro threaded pipeline can still achieves an ipc of 0 8 in the peak performance which is some 6 times better than a conventional scalar pipeline if we further degrade cache performance by using an artificially small cache line size the performance of conventional scalar pipeline gives an ipc of 0 02 whereas with unlimited registers the micro threaded pipeline still manages to achieve and ipc of 0 8 a factor of 40 difference in performance micro thread micro threaded pipeline performance evaluation scalar pipeline,236,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
35,0,0,7,346,"Modified Agile Practices for Outsourced Software Projects Frustration with the bureaucratic nature of the disciplined approach has led to the call for agile development. The new approach is defined by the Agile Manifesto (http://agilemanifesto.org/), which values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and agility in responding to change over following a prescribed plan. Agile development does not focus on process improvement; instead it focuses on customer satisfaction and employee empowerment. This is evident from reading the stated values and principles of the Agile Manifesto, which include fairly extreme positions such as ""welcome changing requirements, even late in development"" and ""the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."" An interesting issue arising from the call for agile development is its role in distributed development, which usually translates to offshore development. A recent study indicates that agile practices can reduce temporal, geographical, and socio-cultural distances in distributed development projects. The study researched agile development between teams located in the U.S. and Ireland, and while it reported that overall communication was improved, it also noted problems related to geographical, temporal, and even language distances. Although there are other reported successes of distributed agile development, the projects are generally small, the team members are likely familiar with each other, and the participants are largely experts or high caliber developers. This raises a research, as well as a practical, question: can we extend the use of agile practices from small projects to medium and large projects that involve a significant outsourcing component? To address this question, we must drop constraints such as small size projects, and expert developers belonging to the same company, and examine problems arising from geographical, temporal, and cultural distances. Accordingly, agile practices may need to be modified. In this article, the key issues of software projects with an outsourced component are first identified. These issues are then used as a background to evaluate how standard agile practices stand up when applied to larger projects. This evaluation is followed by recommendations for modified agile practices for outsourced software projects.

39,0,0,10,365,"How a Service-oriented Architecture May Change the Software Development Process Software development practices have evolved substantially during the past decade. As so called ""agile"" approaches have gained more acceptance and applications have become progressively more distributed in terms of their physical execution and the development of components, the service-oriented approach to IT architecture has become an important alternative to traditional software development. Another impetus for the trend to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is provided by enterprise system vendors as they are incorporating the service-oriented paradigm into their products. Substantial efforts related to open standards (such as Web service standards) and open source products (such as open source enterprise service bus, development tools) are further driving a service-oriented approach for information systems. A key question is whether SOA adopters are going to be ready for this change and whether they can provide a technical and an organizational environment in which SOA-related technologies can be leveraged to their full potential. There is some indication that currently this may not be the case. In fact, some organizations that have embarked on SOA-related projects early have experienced disappointments. As with other technology waves, the important question is not whether SOA is inherently a good or a bad idea, but rather how it can be done right in a given context. This article tries to answer this question with respect to the software development process. While much of the literature, both in academia and industry, has focused on business implications of SOA, technological realization, architectural issues, and implementation guidelines, few publications have addressed the impact of SOA on the software development process and its methodology. As with any organizational change, modifications to software development processes or practices entail switching cost. Therefore, individuals as well as organizations are inclined to stay with ""proven"" methodologies, although adjustments based on task requirements and technology characteristics should be key drivers for the methodology choice and are needed to help adopters leverage the full potential of SOA. This article examines the differences and discusses which parts of development process and methodology may require adjustments to effectively leverage a SOA. It presents the results of a field study suggesting changes to software development practices that are necessary to accommodate the unique properties of the service-oriented approach. []",how a service oriented architecture may change the software development process software development practices have evolved substantially during the past decade as so called agile approaches have gained more acceptance and applications have become progressively more distributed in terms of their physical execution and the development of components the service oriented approach to it architecture has become an important alternative to traditional software development another impetus for the trend to a service oriented architecture soa is provided by enterprise system vendors as they are incorporating the service oriented paradigm into their products substantial efforts related to open standards such as web service standards and open source products such as open source enterprise service bus development tools are further driving a service oriented approach for information systems a key question is whether soa adopters are going to be ready for this change and whether they can provide a technical and an organizational environment in which soa related technologies can be leveraged to their full potential there is some indication that currently this may not be the case in fact some organizations that have embarked on soa related projects early have experienced disappointments as with other technology waves the important question is not whether soa is inherently a good or a bad idea but rather how it can be done right in a given context this article tries to answer this question with respect to the software development process while much of the literature both in academia and industry has focused on business implications of soa technological realization architectural issues and implementation guidelines few publications have addressed the impact of soa on the software development process and its methodology as with any organizational change modifications to software development processes or practices entail switching cost therefore individuals as well as organizations are inclined to stay with proven methodologies although adjustments based on task requirements and technology characteristics should be key drivers for the methodology choice and are needed to help adopters leverage the full potential of soa this article examines the differences and discusses which parts of development process and methodology may require adjustments to effectively leverage a soa it presents the results of a field study suggesting changes to software development practices that are necessary to accommodate the unique properties of the service oriented approach,383,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

TxLinux, which is a modification of Linux, is the first real-scale benchmark for transactional memory (TM). MetaTM is a modification of the x86 architecture that supports HTM in general and TxLi-nux specifically.This paper describes and measures TxLinux and MetaTM, the HTM model that supports it. TxLinux greatly benefits from a new primitive, called the cooperative transactional spinlock (cxspinlock) that allows locks and transactions to protect the same data while maintaining the advantages of both synchronization primitives. Integrating the TxLi-nux scheduler with the MetaTM's architectural support for HTM eliminates priority inversion for several real-world benchmarks []",txlinux and metatm transactional memory and the operating system txlinux is the first operating system to use hardware trans actional memory htm as a synchronization primitive and the first to manage htm in the scheduler txlinux which is a modification of linux is the first real scale benchmark for transactional memory tm metatm is a modification of the x86 architecture that supports htm in general and txli nux specifically this paper describes and measures txlinux and metatm the htm model that supports it txlinux greatly benefits from a new primitive called the cooperative transactional spinlock cxspinlock that allows locks and transactions to protect the same data while maintaining the advantages of both synchronization primitives integrating the txli nux scheduler with the metatm s architectural support for htm eliminates priority inversion for several real world benchmarks,135,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

50,0,4,9,112,"IRI-h, a Java-based Distance Education System: Architecture and Performance We used our Original Interactive Remote Instruction (IRI) system to teach scores of university classes over the past years at sites up to 300 km apart. While this system is a prototype, its use in real classes allows us to deal with crucial issues in distributed education instruction systems. We describe our motivation and vision for a reimplementation of IRI that supports synchronous and asynchronous distance education.

51,0,20,14,328,"An Alternate Design Paradigm for Low-power, Low-cost, Testable Hybrid Systems Using Scaled LTPS TFTs This article presents a holistic hybrid design methodology for low-power, low-cost, testable digital designs using low-temperature polycrystalline-silicon thin-film transistors (LTPS TFTs). An alternate scaling rule under low thermal budget (due to flexible substrate) is developed to improve the performance of TFTs in the presence of process variation. We demonstrate that LTPS TFTs can be further optimized for ultralow-power subthreshold operation with performances comparable to contemporary single-crystal silicon-on-insulator (c-Si SOI) devices after process optimization. The optimized LTPS TFTs with high current drivability and less variability can comprise a promising low-cost option to augment Si CMOS technology, opening up a plethora of new hybrid 3D applications. We illustrate one such application: IC testing. Testing of complex VLSI systems is a prime concern due to design cost of DFT circuits, area/delay overheads, and poor test confidence. To harness the benefits of TFT technology, a novel low-power, process-tolerant, generic, and reconfigurable test structure designed using LTPS TFTs is proposed to reduce the test cost, as well as to improve diagnosability and verifiability, of complex VLSI systems. Due to proper optimization of TFT devices, the proposed test structure consumes low power but operates with reasonable performance. Furthermore, the test circuits do not consume any silicon area because they can be integrated on-chip using 3D technology. Since the test architecture is reconfigurable, this eliminates the need to redesign built-in-self-test (BIST) components that may vary from one processor generation to another. We have developed test structures using 200nm TFT devices and evaluated them on designs implemented in 130nm bulk CMOS. For circuit simulations, we have developed a SPICE-compatible model for TFT devices. The BIST components designed using the test structures operate at 0.8--4.3 GHz (compared to 8.2 GHz in bulk CMOS) with low power consumption. The enhanced scan cells partially implemented in TFT (3D hybrid design) consume ∼24% less power and ∼15--20% less area of Si die compared to conventional bulk-Si design (2D planar design), with minimal delay overhead. 3D integration, BIST, DFT, Low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS), generic, grain boundary (GB), hybrid system, inherent variation, reconfigurable, thin-film transistor (TFT)",an alternate design paradigm for low power low cost testable hybrid systems using scaled ltps tfts this article presents a holistic hybrid design methodology for low power low cost testable digital designs using low temperature polycrystalline silicon thin film transistors ltps tfts an alternate scaling rule under low thermal budget due to flexible substrate is developed to improve the performance of tfts in the presence of process variation we demonstrate that ltps tfts can be further optimized for ultralow power subthreshold operation with performances comparable to contemporary single crystal silicon on insulator c si soi devices after process optimization the optimized ltps tfts with high current drivability and less variability can comprise a promising low cost option to augment si cmos technology opening up a plethora of new hybrid 3d applications we illustrate one such application ic testing testing of complex vlsi systems is a prime concern due to design cost of dft circuits area delay overheads and poor test confidence to harness the benefits of tft technology a novel low power process tolerant generic and reconfigurable test structure designed using ltps tfts is proposed to reduce the test cost as well as to improve diagnosability and verifiability of complex vlsi systems due to proper optimization of tft devices the proposed test structure consumes low power but operates with reasonable performance furthermore the test circuits do not consume any silicon area because they can be integrated on chip using 3d technology since the test architecture is reconfigurable this eliminates the need to redesign built in self test bist components that may vary from one processor generation to another we have developed test structures using 200nm tft devices and evaluated them on designs implemented in 130nm bulk cmos for circuit simulations we have developed a spice compatible model for tft devices the bist components designed using the test structures operate at 0 8 4 3 ghz compared to 8 2 ghz in bulk cmos with low power consumption the enhanced scan cells partially implemented in tft 3d hybrid design consume 24 less power and 15 20 less area of si die compared to conventional bulk si design 2d planar design with minimal delay overhead 3d integration bist dft low temperature polycrystalline silicon ltps generic grain boundary gb hybrid system inherent variation reconfigurable thin film transistor tft,385,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
52,0,0,8,204,"Joint Local and Global Hardware Adaptations for Energy This work concerns algorithms to control energy-driven architecture adaptations for multimedia applications, without and with dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). We identify a broad design space for adaptation control algorithms based on two attributes: (1) when to adapt or temporal granularity and (2) what structures to adapt or spatial granularity. For each attribute, adaptation may be global or local. Our previous work developed a temporally and spatially global algorithm. It invokes adaptation at the granularity of a full frame of a multimedia application (temporally global) and considers the entire hardware configuration at a time (spatially global). It exploits inter-frame execution time variability, slowing computation just enough to eliminate idle time before the real-time deadline.This paper explores temporally and spatially local algorithms and their integration with the previous global algorithm. The local algorithms invoke architectural adaptation within an application frame to exploit intra-frame execution variability, and attempt to save energy without affecting execution time. We consider local algorithms previously studied for non-real-time applications as well as propose new algorithms. We find that, for systems without and with DVS, the local algorithms are effective in saving energy for multimedia applications, but the new integrated global and local algorithm is best for the systems and applications studied.

53,0,11,12,217,"Learning and Leveraging the Relationship Between Architecture-Level Measurements and Individual User Satisfaction The ultimate goal of computer design is to satisfy the end-user. In particular computing domains, such as interactive applications, there exists a variation in user expectations and user satisfaction relative to the performance of existing computer systems. In this work, we leverage this variation to develop more efficient architectures that are customized to end-users. We first investigate the relationship between microarchitectural parameters and user satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between hardware performance counter (HPC) readings and individual satisfaction levels reported by users for representative applications. Our results show that the satisfaction of the user is strongly correlated to the performance of the underlying hardware. More importantly, the results show that user satisfaction is highly user-dependent. To take advantage of these observations, we develop a framework called Individualized Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (iDVFS). We study a group of users to characterize the relationship between the HPCs and individual user satisfaction levels. Based on this analysis, we use artificial neural networks to model the function from HPCs to user satisfaction for individual users.

54,0,9,11,186,"Moguls: A Model to Explore the Memory Hierarchy for Bandwidth Improvements In recent years, the increasing number of processor cores and limited increases in main memory bandwidth have led to the problem of the bandwidth wall, where memory bandwidth is becoming a performance bottleneck. This is especially true for emerging latency-insensitive, bandwidth-sensitive applications. Designing the memory hierarchy for a platform with an emphasis on maximizing bandwidth within a fixed power budget becomes one of the key challenges. To facilitate architects to quickly explore the design space of memory hierarchies, we propose an analytical performance model called Moguls. The Moguls model estimates the performance of an application on a system, using the bandwidth demand of the application for a range of cache capacities and the bandwidth provided by the system with those capacities. We show how to extend this model with appropriate approximations to optimize a cache hierarchy under a power constraint. The results show how many levels of cache should be designed, and what the capacity, bandwidth, and technology of each level should be. In addition, we study memory hierarchy design with hybrid memory technologies, which shows the benefits of using multiple technologies for future computing systems. bandwidth, memory hierarchy, memory model, power consumption, throughput computing",moguls a model to explore the memory hierarchy for bandwidth improvements in recent years the increasing number of processor cores and limited increases in main memory bandwidth have led to the problem of the bandwidth wall where memory bandwidth is becoming a performance bottleneck this is especially true for emerging latency insensitive bandwidth sensitive applications designing the memory hierarchy for a platform with an emphasis on maximizing bandwidth within a fixed power budget becomes one of the key challenges to facilitate architects to quickly explore the design space of memory hierarchies we propose an analytical performance model called moguls the moguls model estimates the performance of an application on a system using the bandwidth demand of the application for a range of cache capacities and the bandwidth provided by the system with those capacities we show how to extend this model with appropriate approximations to optimize a cache hierarchy under a power constraint the results show how many levels of cache should be designed and what the capacity bandwidth and technology of each level should be in addition we study memory hierarchy design with hybrid memory technologies which shows the benefits of using multiple technologies for future computing systems bandwidth memory hierarchy memory model power consumption throughput computing,208,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
55,0,0,15,256,"Improving Branch Prediction by Dynamic Dataflow-based Identification of Correlated Branches from a Large Global History Deep pipelines and fast clock rates are necessitating the development of high accuracy, multi-stage branch predictors for future processors. Such a predictor uses a collection of predictors, each of which provides its predictions at a different stage of the pipeline front-end. A simple 1-cycle latency line predictor provides predictions in the first stage, followed in a couple of stages later by predictions from a more accurate global predictor. Finally, one or two stages later, a highly accurate corrector predictor selectively corrects the global predictor's prediction. As the corrector predictor has the final say, its accuracy must be very high. The focus of this paper is to propose and evaluate techniques to build high-accuracy corrector predictors.Our techniques rely on using a long global history, and identifying correlated branches in this history by using runtime dataflow information. In particular, we identify for each dynamic branch a set of branches called ""affectors"", which control the computation that affect that branch's outcome. We propose efficient hardware structures to track dataflow and to identify the affector branches for each dynamic branch; the hardware overhead for identifying affectors for all dynamic branches from a 64 branch global history is only 312 bytes. We then propose two prediction schemes that put to use the affector branch information. Experimental studies show that adding an 8KB corrector predictor (that uses affector information) to a 16KB perceptron predictor (total size 24.2KB) reduces the average misprediction rate for 12 benchmarks from 6.3% to 5.7%, an improvement achieved only by a 64KB perceptron predictor.

56,0,0,11,139,"Secure I/O Device Sharing Among Virtual Machines on Multiple Hosts Virtualization allows flexible mappings between physical resources and virtual entities, and improves allocation efficiency and agility. Unfortunately, most existing virtualization technologies are limited to resources in a single host. This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a multi-host I/O device virtualization system called Ladon, which enables I/O devices to be shared among virtual machines running on multiple hosts in a secure and efficient way. Specifically, Ladon uses a PCIe network to connect multiple servers with PCIe devices and allows VMs running on these servers to directly interact with these PCIe devices without interfering with one another. Through an evaluation of a fully operational Ladon prototype, we show that there is no throughput and latency penalty of the multi-host I/O virtualization enabled by Ladon compared to those of the existing single-host I/O virtualization technology. []",secure i o device sharing among virtual machines on multiple hosts virtualization allows flexible mappings between physical resources and virtual entities and improves allocation efficiency and agility unfortunately most existing virtualization technologies are limited to resources in a single host this paper presents the design implementation and evaluation of a multi host i o device virtualization system called ladon which enables i o devices to be shared among virtual machines running on multiple hosts in a secure and efficient way specifically ladon uses a pcie network to connect multiple servers with pcie devices and allows vms running on these servers to directly interact with these pcie devices without interfering with one another through an evaluation of a fully operational ladon prototype we show that there is no throughput and latency penalty of the multi host i o virtualization enabled by ladon compared to those of the existing single host i o virtualization technology,153,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Although fault rates of individual transistorsmay not rise significantly, incorporating more transistors into adevice makes that device more likely to encounter a fault. Hence,maintaining processor error rates at acceptable levels will requireincreasing design effort.This paper proposes two simple approaches to reduce errorrates and evaluates their application to a microprocessor instructionqueue. The first technique reduces the time instructions sit invulnerable storage structures by selectively squashing instructionswhen long delays are encountered. A fault is less likely to cause anerror if the structure it affects does not contain valid instructions.We introduce a new metric, MITF (Mean Instructions To Failure),to capture the trade-off between performance and reliability introducedby this approach.The second technique addresses false detected errors. In theabsence of a fault detection mechanism, such errors would nothave affected the final outcome of a program. For example, a faultaffecting the result of a dynamically dead instruction would notchange the final program output, but could still be flagged by thehardware as an error. To avoid signalling such false errors, wemodify a pipeline's error detection logic to mark affected instructionsand data as possibly incorrect rather than immediately signalingan error. Then, we signal an error only if we determine laterthat the possibly incorrect value could have affected the program'soutput.

58,0,12,8,235,"Reducing Cache Power with Low-cost, Multi-bit Error-correcting Codes Technology advancements have enabled the integration of large on-die embedded DRAM (eDRAM) caches. eDRAM is significantly denser than traditional SRAMs, but must be periodically refreshed to retain data. Like SRAM, eDRAM is susceptible to device variations, which play a role in determining refresh time for eDRAM cells. Refresh power potentially represents a large fraction of overall system power, particularly during low-power states when the CPU is idle. Future designs need to reduce cache power without incurring the high cost of flushing cache data when entering low-power states. In this paper, we show the significant impact of variations on refresh time and cache power consumption for large eDRAM caches. We propose Hi-ECC, a technique that incorporates multi-bit error-correcting codes to significantly reduce refresh rate. Multi-bit error-correcting codes usually have a complex decoder design and high storage cost. Hi-ECC avoids the decoder complexity by using strong ECC codes to identify and disable sections of the cache with multi-bit failures, while providing efficient single-bit error correction for the common case. Hi-ECC includes additional optimizations that allow us to amortize the storage cost of the code over large data words, providing the benefit of multi-bit correction at same storage cost as a single-bit error-correcting (SECDED) code (2% overhead). Our proposal achieves a 93% reduction in refresh power vs. a baseline eDRAM cache without error correcting capability, and a 66% reduction in refresh power vs. a system using SECDED codes. dram, ecc, edram, idle power, idle states, multi-bit ecc, refresh power, vccmin",reducing cache power with low cost multi bit error correcting codes technology advancements have enabled the integration of large on die embedded dram edram caches edram is significantly denser than traditional srams but must be periodically refreshed to retain data like sram edram is susceptible to device variations which play a role in determining refresh time for edram cells refresh power potentially represents a large fraction of overall system power particularly during low power states when the cpu is idle future designs need to reduce cache power without incurring the high cost of flushing cache data when entering low power states in this paper we show the significant impact of variations on refresh time and cache power consumption for large edram caches we propose hi ecc a technique that incorporates multi bit error correcting codes to significantly reduce refresh rate multi bit error correcting codes usually have a complex decoder design and high storage cost hi ecc avoids the decoder complexity by using strong ecc codes to identify and disable sections of the cache with multi bit failures while providing efficient single bit error correction for the common case hi ecc includes additional optimizations that allow us to amortize the storage cost of the code over large data words providing the benefit of multi bit correction at same storage cost as a single bit error correcting secded code 2 overhead our proposal achieves a 93 reduction in refresh power vs a baseline edram cache without error correcting capability and a 66 reduction in refresh power vs a system using secded codes dram ecc edram idle power idle states multi bit ecc refresh power vccmin,274,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
59,0,11,11,201,"Trading off Cache Capacity for Reliability to Enable Low Voltage Operation One of the most effective techniques to reduce a processor's power consumption is to reduce supply voltage. However, reducing voltage in the context of manufacturing-induced parameter variations cancause many types of memory circuits to fail. As a result, voltage scaling is limited by a minimum voltage, often called Vccmin, beyond which circuits may not operate reliably. Large memory structures (e.g., caches) typically set Vccmin for the whole processor. In this paper, we propose two architectural techniques that enable microprocessor caches (L1and L2), to operate at low voltages despite very high memory cell failure rates. The Word-disable scheme combines two consecutive cache lines, to form a single cache line where only non-failing words are used. The Bit-fix scheme uses a quarter of the ways in a cache set to store positions and fix bits for failing bits in other ways of the set. During high voltage operation, both schemes allow use of the entire cache. During low voltage operation, they sacrifice cache capacity by 50% and 25%, respectively, to reduce Vccmin below 500mV. Compared to current designs with a Vccmin of 825mV, our schemes enable a 40% voltage reduction, which reduces power by 85% and energy per instruction (EPI) by 53% SRAM, Vccmin, cache, cache design, low power, low voltage, reliability, stability",trading off cache capacity for reliability to enable low voltage operation one of the most effective techniques to reduce a processor s power consumption is to reduce supply voltage however reducing voltage in the context of manufacturing induced parameter variations cancause many types of memory circuits to fail as a result voltage scaling is limited by a minimum voltage often called vccmin beyond which circuits may not operate reliably large memory structures e g caches typically set vccmin for the whole processor in this paper we propose two architectural techniques that enable microprocessor caches l1and l2 to operate at low voltages despite very high memory cell failure rates the word disable scheme combines two consecutive cache lines to form a single cache line where only non failing words are used the bit fix scheme uses a quarter of the ways in a cache set to store positions and fix bits for failing bits in other ways of the set during high voltage operation both schemes allow use of the entire cache during low voltage operation they sacrifice cache capacity by 50 and 25 respectively to reduce vccmin below 500mv compared to current designs with a vccmin of 825mv our schemes enable a 40 voltage reduction which reduces power by 85 and energy per instruction epi by 53 sram vccmin cache cache design low power low voltage reliability stability,228,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This trend will be further underscored with the widespread adoption of secure protocols such as secure IP (IPSEC) and virtual private networks (VPNs). In this paper, we introduce the CryptoManiac processor, a fast and flexible co-processor for cryptographic workloads. Our design is extremely efficient; we present analysis of a 0.25um physical design that runs the standard Rijndael cipher algorithm 2.25 times faster than a 600MHz Alpha 21264 processor. Moreover, our implementation requires 1/100th the area and power in the same technology. We demonstrate that the performance of our design rivals a state-of-the-art dedicated hardware implementation of the 3DES (triple DES) algorithm, while retaining the flexibility to simultaneously support multiple cipher algorithms. Finally, we define a scalable system architecture that combines CryptoManiac processing elements to exploit inter-session and inter-packet parallelism available in many communication protocols. Using I/O traces and detailed timing simulation, we show that chip multiprocessor configurations can effectively service high throughput applications including secure web and disk I/O processing.

Unlike state-of-the-art DAS with static configurations, the system and software architecture changes at runtime. To handle configuration changes, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and automatic orchestration is a promising approach. Whenever systems are set up automatically, they have to be validated. This paper presents an approach based on formal methods. Existing component models are annotated with Quality-of-Service parameters and transformed automatically to Hybrid Automata. These automata are then composed to an overall system model and model checking is used to check safety properties. The complete transformation-orchestration-validation process is executed without user interaction and thus can be performed at runtime.

62,0,9,4,178,"Scalable Application Layer Multicast We describe a new scalable application-layer multicast protocol, specifically designed for low-bandwidth, data streaming applications with large receiver sets. Our scheme is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the application-layer multicast peers and can support a number of different data delivery trees with desirable properties.We present extensive simulations of both our protocol and the Narada application-layer multicast protocol over Internet-like topologies. Our results show that for groups of size 32 or more, our protocol has lower link stress (by about 25%), improved or similar end-to-end latencies and similar failure recovery properties. More importantly, it is able to achieve these results by using orders of magnitude lower control traffic.Finally, we present results from our wide-area testbed in which we experimented with 32-100 member groups distributed over 8 different sites. In our experiments, average group members established and maintained low-latency paths and incurred a maximum packet loss rate of less than 1% as members randomly joined and left the multicast group.

63,0,14,16,178,"Rigorous Specification and Conformance Testing Techniques for Network Protocols, As Applied to TCP, UDP, and Sockets Network protocols are hard to implement correctly. Despite the existence of RFCs and other standards, implementations often have subtle differences and bugs. One reason for this is that the specifications are typically informal, and hence inevitably contain ambiguities. Conformance testing against such specifications is challenging.In this paper we present a practical technique for rigorous protocol specification that supports specification-based testing. We have applied it to TCP, UDP, and the Sockets API, developing a detailed 'post-hoc' specification that accurately reflects the behaviour of several existing implementations (FreeBSD 4.6, Linux 2.4.20-8, and Windows XP SP1). The development process uncovered a number of differences between and infelicities in these implementations.Our experience shows for the first time that rigorous specification is feasible for protocols as complex as TCP@. We argue that the technique is also applicable 'pre-hoc', in the design phase of new protocols. We discuss how such a design-for-test approach should influence protocol development, leading to protocol specifications that are both unambiguous and clear, and to high-quality implementations that can be tested directly against those specifications.

64,0,6,11,168,"The Cost of a Cloud: Research Problems in Data Center Networks The data centers used to create cloud services represent a significant investment in capital outlay and ongoing costs. Accordingly, we first examine the costs of cloud service data centers today. The cost breakdown reveals the importance of optimizing work completed per dollar invested. Unfortunately, the resources inside the data centers often operate at low utilization due to resource stranding and fragmentation. To attack this first problem, we propose (1) increasing network agility, and (2) providing appropriate incentives to shape resource consumption. Second, we note that cloud service providers are building out geo-distributed networks of data centers. Geo-diversity lowers latency to users and increases reliability in the presence of an outage taking out an entire site. However, without appropriate design and management, these geo-diverse data center networks can raise the cost of providing service. Moreover, leveraging geo-diversity requires services be designed to benefit from it. To attack this problem, we propose (1) joint optimization of network and data center resources, and (2) new systems and mechanisms for geo-distributing state. cloud-service data centers, costs, network challenges",the cost of a cloud research problems in data center networks the data centers used to create cloud services represent a significant investment in capital outlay and ongoing costs accordingly we first examine the costs of cloud service data centers today the cost breakdown reveals the importance of optimizing work completed per dollar invested unfortunately the resources inside the data centers often operate at low utilization due to resource stranding and fragmentation to attack this first problem we propose 1 increasing network agility and 2 providing appropriate incentives to shape resource consumption second we note that cloud service providers are building out geo distributed networks of data centers geo diversity lowers latency to users and increases reliability in the presence of an outage taking out an entire site however without appropriate design and management these geo diverse data center networks can raise the cost of providing service moreover leveraging geo diversity requires services be designed to benefit from it to attack this problem we propose 1 joint optimization of network and data center resources and 2 new systems and mechanisms for geo distributing state cloud service data centers costs network challenges,191,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
65,0,4,8,208,"VL2: A Scalable and Flexible Data Center Network To be agile and cost effective, data centers should allow dynamic resource allocation across large server pools. In particular, the data center network should enable any server to be assigned to any service. To meet these goals, we present VL2, a practical network architecture that scales to support huge data centers with uniform high capacity between servers, performance isolation between services, and Ethernet layer-2 semantics. VL2 uses (1) flat addressing to allow service instances to be placed anywhere in the network, (2) Valiant Load Balancing to spread traffic uniformly across network paths, and (3) end-system based address resolution to scale to large server pools, without introducing complexity to the network control plane. VL2's design is driven by detailed measurements of traffic and fault data from a large operational cloud service provider.

66,0,16,11,244,"Automated Tools to Implement and Test Internet Systems in Reconfigurable Hardware Tools have been developed to automatically integrate and test networking systems in reconfigurable hardware. These tools dynamically generate circuits for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A library of hardware-accelerated modules has been developed that processes Internet Protocol (IP) packets, performs header rule matching, scans pocket payloads, and implements per-flow queueing. Other functions can be added to the library as extensible modules.An integration tool was developed to enable a network administrator to specify how a customized system should examine, drop, buffer, and/or modify packets. This tool joins together modules from the library to create a composite circuit that performs multiple functions. The tool allows additional modules to be quickly added to the library and integrated into systems. The integration tool has been used to create circuits that perform Internet firewall, network intrusion detection, network intrusion prevention, and Denial of Service (DoS) attack protection functions.A test tool was developed to automatically verify that circuits created by the integration tool run properly in reconfigurable hardware. Circuits created by the integration tool are deployed into a Field-programmable Port Extender (FPX) platform. As new modules were added to the library, the test tool reconfigured the logic on the FPX, injected traffic, and monitored the resulting packets.By using hardware, not software, networking system can process millions of packets per second.

67,0,5,12,192,"On-chip Networks from a Networking Perspective: Congestion and Scalability in Many-core Interconnects In this paper, we present network-on-chip (NoC) design and contrast it to traditional network design, highlighting similarities and differences between the two. As an initial case study, we examine network congestion in bufferless NoCs. We show that congestion manifests itself differently in a NoC than in traditional networks. Network congestion reduces system throughput in congested workloads for smaller NoCs (16 and 64 nodes), and limits the scalability of larger bufferless NoCs (256 to 4096 nodes) even when traffic has locality (e.g., when an application's required data is mapped nearby to its core in the network). We propose a new source throttling-based congestion control mechanism with application-level awareness that reduces network congestion to improve system performance. Our mechanism improves system performance by up to 28% (15% on average in congested workloads) in smaller NoCs, achieves linear throughput scaling in NoCs up to 4096 cores (attaining similar performance scalability to a NoC with large buffers), and reduces power consumption by up to 20%. Thus, we show an effective application of a network-level concept, congestion control, to a class of networks -- bufferless on-chip networks -- that has not been studied before by the networking community. congestion control, multi-core, on-chip networks",on chip networks from a networking perspective congestion and scalability in many core interconnects in this paper we present network on chip noc design and contrast it to traditional network design highlighting similarities and differences between the two as an initial case study we examine network congestion in bufferless nocs we show that congestion manifests itself differently in a noc than in traditional networks network congestion reduces system throughput in congested workloads for smaller nocs 16 and 64 nodes and limits the scalability of larger bufferless nocs 256 to 4096 nodes even when traffic has locality e g when an application s required data is mapped nearby to its core in the network we propose a new source throttling based congestion control mechanism with application level awareness that reduces network congestion to improve system performance our mechanism improves system performance by up to 28 15 on average in congested workloads in smaller nocs achieves linear throughput scaling in nocs up to 4096 cores attaining similar performance scalability to a noc with large buffers and reduces power consumption by up to 20 thus we show an effective application of a network level concept congestion control to a class of networks bufferless on chip networks that has not been studied before by the networking community congestion control multi core on chip networks,220,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
68,0,6,11,163,"Papyrus: A Software Platform for Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Using SDRs Proliferation and innovation of wireless technologies require significant amounts of radio spectrum. Recent policy reforms by the FCC are paving the way by freeing up spectrum for a new generation of frequency-agile wireless devices based on software defined radios (SDRs). But despite recent advances in SDR hardware, research on SDR MAC protocols or applications requires an experimental platform for managing physical access. We introduce Papyrus, a software platform for wireless researchers to develop and experiment dynamic spectrum systems using currently available SDR hardware. Papyrus provides two fundamental building blocks at the physical layer: flexible non-contiguous frequency access and simple and robust frequency detection. Papyrus allows researchers to deploy and experiment new MAC protocols and applications on USRP GNU Radio, and can also be ported to other SDR platforms.

69,0,11,9,122,"A Story-telling Approach for a Software Engineering Course Design Advanced programming and software engineering techniques are challenging to learn due to their inherent complexity. However, to the average student they are even more challenging because they have never experienced the context in which the techniques are appropriate. For instance, why learn design patterns to increase maintainability when student exercises are never maintained? In this paper, we outline the contextual problems that software engineering teaching has to deal with and present a story telling approach for course design as a remedy. We outline the stories that over the last five years have structured lecturing and mandatory exercises for our advanced programming/software engineering course, and present benefits, liabilities, and experiences with the approach comparing it to the normal, topic structured, course design. agile methods, curriculum design, design patterns, frameworks, software architecture, test-driven development.",a story telling approach for a software engineering course design advanced programming and software engineering techniques are challenging to learn due to their inherent complexity however to the average student they are even more challenging because they have never experienced the context in which the techniques are appropriate for instance why learn design patterns to increase maintainability when student exercises are never maintained in this paper we outline the contextual problems that software engineering teaching has to deal with and present a story telling approach for course design as a remedy we outline the stories that over the last five years have structured lecturing and mandatory exercises for our advanced programming software engineering course and present benefits liabilities and experiences with the approach comparing it to the normal topic structured course design agile methods curriculum design design patterns frameworks software architecture test driven development,144,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
70,0,15,7,168,"Exploring Studio-based Instructional Models for Computing Education While the demand for college graduates with computing skills continues to rise, such skills no longer equate to mere programming skills. Modern day computing jobs demand design, communication, and collaborative work skills as well. Since traditional instructional methods in computing education tend to focus on programming skills, we believe that a fundamental rethinking of computing education is in order. We are exploring a new ""studio-based"" pedagogy that actively engages undergraduate students in collaborative, design-oriented learning. Adapted from architectural education, the studio-based instructional model emphasizes learning activities in which students (a) construct personalized solutions to assigned computing problems, and (b) present solutions to their instructors and peers for feedback and discussion within the context of ""design crits."" We describe and motivate the studio-based approach, review previous efforts to apply it to computer science education, and propose an agenda for multi-institutional research into the design and impact of studio-based instructional models. We invite educators to participate in a community of research and practice to advance studio-based learning in computing education. cs ed. research, cs1, cs2, cs3, design crits, pre-cs1, student-constructed artifacts, studio-based learning and instruction",exploring studio based instructional models for computing education while the demand for college graduates with computing skills continues to rise such skills no longer equate to mere programming skills modern day computing jobs demand design communication and collaborative work skills as well since traditional instructional methods in computing education tend to focus on programming skills we believe that a fundamental rethinking of computing education is in order we are exploring a new studio based pedagogy that actively engages undergraduate students in collaborative design oriented learning adapted from architectural education the studio based instructional model emphasizes learning activities in which students a construct personalized solutions to assigned computing problems and b present solutions to their instructors and peers for feedback and discussion within the context of design crits we describe and motivate the studio based approach review previous efforts to apply it to computer science education and propose an agenda for multi institutional research into the design and impact of studio based instructional models we invite educators to participate in a community of research and practice to advance studio based learning in computing education cs ed research cs1 cs2 cs3 design crits pre cs1 student constructed artifacts studio based learning and instruction,201,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
71,0,12,12,107,"Tools and Techniques for Large Scale Grading Using Web-based Commercial Off-the-shelf Software Courseware/Course Management Systems (CMS) such as WebCT or Blackboard are an increasingly popular way to provide a web presence for a course. However, their current web-browser reliance makes it difficult for them to provide functionality that could be useful to computer science instructors. This paper describes our augmentation of a CMS in a large introductory computer science class.

72,0,4,9,124,"A TDD Approach to Introducing Students to Embedded Programming Learning embedded programming is a highly demanding exercise. The beginner is bombarded with complexity from the start: embedded production based around a myriad of C++ constructs with low-level elements integrated onto ever more complicated processor architectures. The picture is further compounded by tool support having unfamiliar roles and appearances from previous student experiences. This demanding situation often has the student bewildered; seeking for ""a crutch"" or the simplest way forward regardless of the overall consequences. To control this potentially chaotic picture, the instructor needs to introduce devices to combat this complexity. We argue that test driven development (TDD) should become the instructor's principal weapon in this fight. Reasons for this belief combined with our, and the students', experiences with this novel approach are discussed.

73,0,0,6,130,"Security Applications: Lessons of Real-world Deployment Game theory has played an important role in security decisions. Recent work using Stackelberg games [Fudenberg and Tirole 1991] to model security domains has been particularly influential [Basilico et al. 2009; Kiekintveld et al. 2009; Paruchuri et al. 2008; Pita et al. 2008; Pita et al. 2009]. In a Stackelberg game, a leader (in this case the defender) acts first and commits to a randomized security policy. The follower (attacker) optimizes its reward considering the strategy chosen by the leader. These games are well-suited to representing the problem security forces face in allocating limited resources, such as officers, canine units, and checkpoints. In particular, the fact that the attacker is able to observe the policy reflects the way real terrorist organizations plan attacks using extensive surveillance and long planning cycles.

74,0,0,8,128,"Workshop on Large-scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval Due to the dramatically increasing amount of available data, effective and scalable solutions for data organization and search are essential. Distributed solutions naturally provide promising alternatives to standard centralized approaches. With the computational power of thousands or millions of computers in clusters or peer-to-peer systems, the challenges that arise are manifold, ranging from efficient resource discovery to issues in load balancing and distributed query processing. The 2008 edition of the Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval (LSDS-IR'08) provided a forum for researchers to discuss these problems and to define new directions for the work on Distributed Information Retrieval. The Workshop program featured research contributions in the areas of similarity search, resource selection, network organization schemes, issues of data quality, result ranking techniques and query routing algorithms.

76,0,6,9,220,"Myths and Realities: The Performance Impact of Garbage Collection This paper explores and quantifies garbage collection behavior for three whole heap collectors and generational counterparts: copying semi-space, mark-sweep, and reference counting, the canonical algorithms from which essentially all other collection algorithms are derived. Efficient implementations in MMTk, a Java memory management toolkit, in IBM's Jikes RVM share all common mechanisms to provide a clean experimental platform. Instrumentation separates collector and program behavior, and performance counters measure timing and memory behavior on three architectures.Our experimental design reveals key algorithmic features and how they match program characteristics to explain the direct and indirect costs of garbage collection as a function of heap size on the SPEC JVM benchmarks. For example, we find that the contiguous allocation of copying collectors attains significant locality benefits over free-list allocators. The reduced collection costs of the generational algorithms together with the locality benefit of contiguous allocation motivates a copying nursery for newly allocated objects. These benefits dominate the overheads of generational collectors compared with non-generational and no collection, disputing the myth that ""no garbage collection is good garbage collection."" Performance is less sensitive to the mature space collection algorithm in our benchmarks. However the locality and pointer mutation characteristics for a given program occasionally prefer copying or mark-sweep.

77,0,5,11,120,"The Performance Impact of Kernel Prefetching on Buffer Cache Replacement Algorithms A fundamental challenge in improving the file system performance is to design effective block replacement algorithms to minimize buffer cache misses. Despite the well-known interactions between prefetching and caching, almost all buffer cache replacement algorithms have been proposed and studied comparatively without taking into account file system prefetching which exists in all modern operating systems. This paper shows that such kernel prefetching can have a significant impact on the relative performance in terms of the number of actual disk I/Os of many well-known replacement algorithms; it can not only narrow the performance gap but also change the relative performance benefits of different algorithms. These results demonstrate the importance for buffer caching research to take file system prefetching into consideration. buffer caching, prefetching, replacement algorithms",the performance impact of kernel prefetching on buffer cache replacement algorithms a fundamental challenge in improving the file system performance is to design effective block replacement algorithms to minimize buffer cache misses despite the well known interactions between prefetching and caching almost all buffer cache replacement algorithms have been proposed and studied comparatively without taking into account file system prefetching which exists in all modern operating systems this paper shows that such kernel prefetching can have a significant impact on the relative performance in terms of the number of actual disk i os of many well known replacement algorithms it can not only narrow the performance gap but also change the relative performance benefits of different algorithms these results demonstrate the importance for buffer caching research to take file system prefetching into consideration buffer caching prefetching replacement algorithms,138,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
78,0,7,8,223,"Low Traffic Overlay Networks with Large Routing Tables The routing tables of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) can vary from size O(1) to O(n). Currently, what is lacking is an analytic framework to suggest the optimal routing table size for a given workload. This paper (1) compares DHTs with O(1) to O(n) routing tables and identifies some good design points; and (2) proposes protocols to realize the potential of those good design points.We use total traffic as the uniform metric to compare heterogeneous DHTs and emphasize the balance between maintenance cost and lookup cost. Assuming a node on average processes 1,000 or more lookups during its entire lifetime, our analysis shows that large routing tables actually lead to both low traffic and low lookup hops. These good design points translate into one-hop routing for systems of medium size and two-hop routing for large systems.Existing one-hop or two-hop protocols are based on a hierarchy. We instead demonstrate that it is possible to achieve completely decentralized one-hop or two-hop routing, i.e., without giving up being peer-to-peer. We propose 1h-Calot for one-hop routing and 2h-Calot for two-hop routing. Assuming a moderate lookup rate, compared with DHTs that use O(log n) routing tables, 1h-Calot and 2h-Calot save traffic by up to 70% while resolving lookups in one or two hops as opposed to O(log n) hops. distributed hash table, overlay network, peer-to-peer system",low traffic overlay networks with large routing tables the routing tables of distributed hash tables dhts can vary from size o 1 to o n currently what is lacking is an analytic framework to suggest the optimal routing table size for a given workload this paper 1 compares dhts with o 1 to o n routing tables and identifies some good design points and 2 proposes protocols to realize the potential of those good design points we use total traffic as the uniform metric to compare heterogeneous dhts and emphasize the balance between maintenance cost and lookup cost assuming a node on average processes 1 000 or more lookups during its entire lifetime our analysis shows that large routing tables actually lead to both low traffic and low lookup hops these good design points translate into one hop routing for systems of medium size and two hop routing for large systems existing one hop or two hop protocols are based on a hierarchy we instead demonstrate that it is possible to achieve completely decentralized one hop or two hop routing i e without giving up being peer to peer we propose 1h calot for one hop routing and 2h calot for two hop routing assuming a moderate lookup rate compared with dhts that use o log n routing tables 1h calot and 2h calot save traffic by up to 70 while resolving lookups in one or two hops as opposed to o log n hops distributed hash table overlay network peer to peer system,254,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

80,0,0,6,114,"A QoS WMN with Mobility Support We present QMesh, a software package that allows utilizing multiple geographically scattered Windows desktops as a wireless mesh network infrastructure with seamless user mobility support. QMesh supports its users through standard protocols, and does not require any client software installation. We optimize the solution's quality of service (QoS) by providing a centralized management infrastructure, which allows an assignment of users to Internet gateways that balances between distance and load considerations.

This capability can be leveraged to provide a multimodal user interface. We describe the end-to-end architecture of our implementation of a multimodal application (voice and graphical user interface) that uses Natural Language Understanding in the speech interface combined with a WAP browser to perform mobile office functions on a cellular phone. A novel aspect of the multimodal platform is that no software is required to be installed on the mobile device. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by a successful trial with 50 users over a 3G mobile network. We outline our framework, present the results and observations made during the trial.

85,0,0,9,218,"Reconciling Schemas of Disparate Data Sources: A Machine-learning Approach A data-integration system provides access to a multitude of data sources through a single mediated schema. A key bottleneck in building such systems has been the laborious manual construction of semantic mappings between the source schemas and the mediated schema. We describe LSD, a system that employs and extends current machine-learning techniques to semi-automatically find such mappings. LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings together with the sources to train a set of learners. Each learner exploits a different type of information either in the source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been trained, LSD finds semantic mappings for a new data source by applying the learners, then combining their predictions using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD can incorporate domain constraints as an additional source of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the structural information in XML documents. Our approach thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to additional learners that may exploit new kinds of information. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains, and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings with a high degree of accuracy.

86,0,0,6,152,"Modeling High-dimensional Index Structures Using Sampling A large number of index structures for high-dimensional data have been proposed previously. In order to tune and compare such index structures, it is vital to have efficient cost prediction techniques for these structures. Previous techniques either assume uniformity of the data or are not applicable to high-dimensional data. We propose the use of sampling to predict the number of accessed index pages during a query execution. Sampling is independent of the dimensionality and preserves clusters which is important for representing skewed data. We present a general model for estimating the index page layout using sampling and show how to compensate for errors. We then give an implementation of our model under restricted memory assumptions and show that it performs well even under these constraints. Errors are minimal and the overall prediction time is up to two orders of magnitude below the time for building and probing the full index without sampling. []",modeling high dimensional index structures using sampling a large number of index structures for high dimensional data have been proposed previously in order to tune and compare such index structures it is vital to have efficient cost prediction techniques for these structures previous techniques either assume uniformity of the data or are not applicable to high dimensional data we propose the use of sampling to predict the number of accessed index pages during a query execution sampling is independent of the dimensionality and preserves clusters which is important for representing skewed data we present a general model for estimating the index page layout using sampling and show how to compensate for errors we then give an implementation of our model under restricted memory assumptions and show that it performs well even under these constraints errors are minimal and the overall prediction time is up to two orders of magnitude below the time for building and probing the full index without sampling,161,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
87,0,7,6,196,"Macroprogramming Heterogeneous Sensor Networks Using Cosmos In this paper, we present COSMOS, a novel architecture for macroprogramming heterogeneous sensor network systems. Macroprogramming specifies aggregate system behavior, as opposed to device-specific programs that code distributed behavior using explicit messaging. COSMOS is comprised of a macroprogramming language, mPL, and an operating system, mOS. mPL macroprograms are statically verifiable compositions of reusable user-specified, or system supported functional components. The mOS node/network operating system provides component management and a lean execution environment for mPL programs in heterogeneous resource-constrained sensor networks. It provides runtime application instantiation, with over-the-air reprogramming of the network. COSMOS facilitates composition of complex real-world applications that are robust, scalable and adaptive in dynamic data-driven sensor network environments. An important and novel aspect of COSMOS is the ability to easily extend its component basis library to add rich macroprogramming abstractions to mPL, tailored to domain and resource constraints, without modifications to the OS. Applications built on COSMOS are currently in use at the Bowen Labs for Structural Engineering, in Purdue University, for high-fidelity structural monitoring. We present a detailed description of the COSMOS architecture, its various components, and a comprehensive experimental evaluation using macro- and micro- benchmarks to demonstrate performance characteristics of COSMOS. dataflow, heterogeneous networks, macroprogramming, wireless sensor networks",macroprogramming heterogeneous sensor networks using cosmos in this paper we present cosmos a novel architecture for macroprogramming heterogeneous sensor network systems macroprogramming specifies aggregate system behavior as opposed to device specific programs that code distributed behavior using explicit messaging cosmos is comprised of a macroprogramming language mpl and an operating system mos mpl macroprograms are statically verifiable compositions of reusable user specified or system supported functional components the mos node network operating system provides component management and a lean execution environment for mpl programs in heterogeneous resource constrained sensor networks it provides runtime application instantiation with over the air reprogramming of the network cosmos facilitates composition of complex real world applications that are robust scalable and adaptive in dynamic data driven sensor network environments an important and novel aspect of cosmos is the ability to easily extend its component basis library to add rich macroprogramming abstractions to mpl tailored to domain and resource constraints without modifications to the os applications built on cosmos are currently in use at the bowen labs for structural engineering in purdue university for high fidelity structural monitoring we present a detailed description of the cosmos architecture its various components and a comprehensive experimental evaluation using macro and micro benchmarks to demonstrate performance characteristics of cosmos dataflow heterogeneous networks macroprogramming wireless sensor networks,217,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

89,0,5,10,167,"Bothnia: A Dual-personality Extension to the Intel Integrated Graphics Driver In this paper, we introduce Bothnia, an extension to the Intel production graphics driver to support a shared virtual memory heterogeneous multithreading programming model. With Bothnia, the Intel graphics device driver can support both the traditional 3D graphics rendering software stack and a new class of heterogeneous multithreaded applications, which can use both IA (Intel Architecture) CPU cores and Intel integrated Graphics and Media Accelerator (GMA) cores in the same virtual address space.

For a set of GPU accelerated media applications on a PC platform with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and the Intel integrated GMA X3000 running under the Windows XP operating system, Bothnia achieves an average speedup of 3.6x compared to using the GPU as a device, primarily due to Bothnia's support for creation of shared virtual address space between heterogeneous threads of the same application spread on both IA CPU and GMA cores.

91,0,0,6,225,"A Stream Compiler for Communication-exposed Architectures With the increasing miniaturization of transistors, wire delays are becoming a dominant factor in microprocessor performance. To address this issue, a number of emerging architectures contain replicated processing units with software-exposed communication between one unit and another (e.g., Raw, SmartMemories, TRIPS). However, for their use to be widespread, it will be necessary to develop compiler technology that enables a portable, high-level language to execute efficiently across a range of wire-exposed architectures.In this paper, we describe our compiler for StreamIt: a high-level, architecture-independent language for streaming applications. We focus on our backend for the Raw processor. Though StreamIt exposes the parallelism and communication patterns of stream programs, some analysis is needed to adapt a stream program to a software-exposed processor. We describe a partitioning algorithm that employs fission and fusion transformations to adjust the granularity of a stream graph, a layout algorithm that maps a stream graph to a given network topology, and a scheduling strategy that generates a fine-grained static communication pattern for each computational element.We have implemented a fully functional compiler that parallelizes StreamIt applications for Raw, including several load-balancing transformations. Using the cycle-accurate Raw simulator, we demonstrate that the StreamIt compiler can automatically map a high-level stream abstraction to Raw without losing performance. We consider this work to be a first step towards a portable programming model for communication-exposed architectures.

92,0,11,6,167,"Practical Taint-based Protection Using Demand Emulation Many software attacks are based on injecting malicious code into a target host. This paper demonstrates the use of a well-known technique, data tainting, to track data received from the network as it propagates through a system and to prevent its execution. Unlike past approaches to taint tracking, which track tainted data by running the system completely in an emulator or simulator, resulting in considerable execution overhead, our work demonstrates the ability to dynamically switch a running system between virtualized and emulated execution. Using this technique, we are able to explore hardware support for taint-based protection that is deployable in real-world situations, as emulation is only used when tainted data is being processed by the CPU. By modifying the CPU, memory, and I/O devices to support taint tracking and protection, we guarantee that data received from the network may not be executed, even if it is written to, and later read from disk. We demonstrate near native speeds for workloads where little taint data is present.

93,0,55,10,161,"Binding requirements and component architecture by using model-based test-driven development Model-based testing is a well known technique to generate automatically highly qualitative tests for a given system based on a simplified testing model. Test-driven development is an established development practice in the agile development projects, which implies firstly the partial specification of a system by using tests, and after this, the development of the system. In test driven development the system implementation is continuously checked against the tests in order to assess its correctness with respect to the specification. In this paper we investigate how can these two methods be combined such that the advantages of these two approaches can be leveraged: highly qualitative test-cases used as specification of requirements and support of a continuous checking of architecture. We propose to formalize sub-sets of requirements into models that are amenable to generate tests by using automatic techniques well-known from model based testing. These tests can then be used to check the system architecture specification against the requirements in a continuous manner. automatic programming, formal specification, object-oriented programming, program testing, program verification, software architecture, software prototyping, model-based test-driven development, component architecture, automatic high qualitative test generation, agile development projects, partial system specification, requirements specification, continuous architecture checking, automatic techniques, system architecture specification, Testing, Computer architecture, Load modeling, Computational modeling, Component architectures, Embedded systems, USA Councils, model-based, test-driven",binding requirements and component architecture by using model based test driven development model based testing is a well known technique to generate automatically highly qualitative tests for a given system based on a simplified testing model test driven development is an established development practice in the agile development projects which implies firstly the partial specification of a system by using tests and after this the development of the system in test driven development the system implementation is continuously checked against the tests in order to assess its correctness with respect to the specification in this paper we investigate how can these two methods be combined such that the advantages of these two approaches can be leveraged highly qualitative test cases used as specification of requirements and support of a continuous checking of architecture we propose to formalize sub sets of requirements into models that are amenable to generate tests by using automatic techniques well known from model based testing these tests can then be used to check the system architecture specification against the requirements in a continuous manner automatic programming formal specification object oriented programming program testing program verification software architecture software prototyping model based test driven development component architecture automatic high qualitative test generation agile development projects partial system specification requirements specification continuous architecture checking automatic techniques system architecture specification testing computer architecture load modeling computational modeling component architectures embedded systems usa councils model based test driven,238,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

95,0,47,9,147,"Web Service Validation Enabling Test-Driven Development of Service-Oriented Applications Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an important software development practice that enables rapid iterations, refactoring, and improved quality. Supporting TDD can be difficult when building Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) applications, since standard test frameworks often do not have capabilities for performing and validating Web service (WS) calls; invoking Web services depends on running and connecting to a service container; and services and clients often have entirely separate implementations. In this paper we present case studies of two SOA applications we developed, GRIDL and TxFlow. These are distributed, multi-language applications using Web services as the interface between service and client components. They implement Web service and client tests both for verification and validation of the application components and to facilitate the TDD process. Our approach to Web service testing to support TDD is easily reproducible in any SOA application without requiring significant development effort or changes to the software design. program verification, software architecture, Web services, Web service validation, test-driven development, software development practice, service-oriented architecture, GRIDL application, TxFlow application, Web services, Application software, Service oriented architecture, Software testing, Programming, Buildings, Performance evaluation, Joining processes, Containers, Software design, Web services, testing, validation, Test-Driven Development, Service Oriented Architecture",web service validation enabling test driven development of service oriented applications test driven development tdd is an important software development practice that enables rapid iterations refactoring and improved quality supporting tdd can be difficult when building service oriented architecture soa applications since standard test frameworks often do not have capabilities for performing and validating web service ws calls invoking web services depends on running and connecting to a service container and services and clients often have entirely separate implementations in this paper we present case studies of two soa applications we developed gridl and txflow these are distributed multi language applications using web services as the interface between service and client components they implement web service and client tests both for verification and validation of the application components and to facilitate the tdd process our approach to web service testing to support tdd is easily reproducible in any soa application without requiring significant development effort or changes to the software design program verification software architecture web services web service validation test driven development software development practice service oriented architecture gridl application txflow application web services application software service oriented architecture software testing programming buildings performance evaluation joining processes containers software design web services testing validation test driven development service oriented architecture,211,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

They emphasize customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less time. In the last decades, to achieve high quality of system, use the architecture as an important matter in the development process. Therefore using software architecture skills in agile methods could improve them toward producing a software system that has an appropriate structure because focuses on achieving quality attributes for a software system.

Over time in the collaboration, we experienced a constant decrease in the pace of our development progress. Planning forward only within the limits of single sprints was the main reason for this. It resulted in a degenerating design and therefore a lack of flexibility that affected the agility of our project. Therefore, we introduced the concept of ""epic-architectures"", an architecture design for a coherent group of user stories. Shifting the planning horizon further, across single sprints, helped us to create more stable and reusable concepts and to construct simpler, more elegant, and more maintainable solutions. We were able to significantly reduce the refactoring effort and increase the development speed, without significant overhead. With reporting on our experiences we hope to provide practically applicable guidance on how to integrate lightweight architecting in agile development processes, to sustain agility while creating high quality products. project management, software architecture, software maintenance, software prototyping, software quality, joint research and development laboratory, Scrum project, project agility, epic-architectures, architecture design, user stories, planning horizon, maintainable solutions, refactoring effort, development speed, lightweight architecting, agile development processes, high quality products, Computer architecture, Planning, Software architecture, Software, Concrete, Documentation, Collaboration, Architecture, agile, Scrum, experience report, industry, sustainable, agility, development",sustaining agility through architecture experiences from a joint research and development laboratory this paper is an experience report of a long running scrum project conducted in a collaboration between industry and research in a so called joint research and development laboratory over time in the collaboration we experienced a constant decrease in the pace of our development progress planning forward only within the limits of single sprints was the main reason for this it resulted in a degenerating design and therefore a lack of flexibility that affected the agility of our project therefore we introduced the concept of epic architectures an architecture design for a coherent group of user stories shifting the planning horizon further across single sprints helped us to create more stable and reusable concepts and to construct simpler more elegant and more maintainable solutions we were able to significantly reduce the refactoring effort and increase the development speed without significant overhead with reporting on our experiences we hope to provide practically applicable guidance on how to integrate lightweight architecting in agile development processes to sustain agility while creating high quality products project management software architecture software maintenance software prototyping software quality joint research and development laboratory scrum project project agility epic architectures architecture design user stories planning horizon maintainable solutions refactoring effort development speed lightweight architecting agile development processes high quality products computer architecture planning software architecture software concrete documentation collaboration architecture agile scrum experience report industry sustainable agility development,243,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

99,0,58,7,165,"Agile Software Architecture in Advanced Data Analytics Requirements evolve over the development lifecycle of a software project. Agile practices are designed specifically to address this challenge while showing early and continuous progress towards project goals. Applying an agile approach allows stakeholders to adapt the scope and capabilities of a development release to changing market needs. More recently, an agile approach has been recommended for developing the architecture of software systems, enabling the design to support current requirements and early releases while evolving to meet future expectations. Our experience defining emergent software systems to build a product line architecture for advanced data analytics demonstrates the benefits that can be gained from prioritizing work activities and delaying architecture decisions. This paper proposes a process and ontology for agile architecture development. Only the necessary aspects for each evolutionary release are designed and prototyped, as determined by expectations of the identified application domain scenarios. Feedback from implementing the scenarios using the architecture extends our understanding of the requirements and provides the backlog for successive design iterations. ontologies (artificial intelligence), software architecture, software prototyping, agile software architecture, advanced data analytics, software project development lifecycle, agile practices, project goals, software system architecture, architecture decisions, ontology, agile architecture development, application domain scenario, design iterations, Computer architecture, Ontologies, Software architecture, Automation, Software systems, Unified modeling language, software architecture, agile development, product line architectures, industrial experiments, industry best practices",agile software architecture in advanced data analytics requirements evolve over the development lifecycle of a software project agile practices are designed specifically to address this challenge while showing early and continuous progress towards project goals applying an agile approach allows stakeholders to adapt the scope and capabilities of a development release to changing market needs more recently an agile approach has been recommended for developing the architecture of software systems enabling the design to support current requirements and early releases while evolving to meet future expectations our experience defining emergent software systems to build a product line architecture for advanced data analytics demonstrates the benefits that can be gained from prioritizing work activities and delaying architecture decisions this paper proposes a process and ontology for agile architecture development only the necessary aspects for each evolutionary release are designed and prototyped as determined by expectations of the identified application domain scenarios feedback from implementing the scenarios using the architecture extends our understanding of the requirements and provides the backlog for successive design iterations ontologies artificial intelligence software architecture software prototyping agile software architecture advanced data analytics software project development lifecycle agile practices project goals software system architecture architecture decisions ontology agile architecture development application domain scenario design iterations computer architecture ontologies software architecture automation software systems unified modeling language software architecture agile development product line architectures industrial experiments industry best practices,230,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Iterative, spiral and agile methods, among others, have introduced increments and iterations in eliciting and discovering requirements within the project life cycle. Yet the authoritative flow of information across organizational boundaries within the enterprise continues to be from requirements to architecture to design. We argue that two additional implicit sources of information should be included in the requirements engineering process, contextual environment concerns and architectural patterns and heuristics. To account for these two sources of implicit requirements information we introduce the concept of forward and backward inferred macro-architectural requirements. Forward inferred macro-architectural requirements are elicited from contextual environment concerns. Backward inferred macro-architectural requirements are extracted through a reverse requirements elicitation process from architectural heuristics and patterns.

101,0,30,6,137,"Scaling Agile: Finding your Agile Tribe The ability of agile practices to scale to ""large"" software development efforts (more than three teams or 30 team members) has been widely debated in recent years. While a variety of inhibitors to scaling agile are frequently cited, this experience report describes how the primary challenge to scaling agile that we faced was finding the right people to build our agile tribe. The effective adoption of agile requires passionate, motivated individuals who accept change, think like a business owner, operate willingly outside team walls, and identify and drive program issues. Finding such a large number of people with these qualities is much more difficult than establishing methods to support communications, progress tracking, and other agile practices. We conclude by describing the attributes of the type of person that we believe will thrive in a large-scale agile shop. software development management, team working, agile practice, software development, agile tribe, large-scale agile shop, Computer architecture, Programming, USA Councils, Software, Testing, Service oriented architecture, Radiation detectors, culture large-scale agile recruiting",scaling agile finding your agile tribe the ability of agile practices to scale to large software development efforts more than three teams or 30 team members has been widely debated in recent years while a variety of inhibitors to scaling agile are frequently cited this experience report describes how the primary challenge to scaling agile that we faced was finding the right people to build our agile tribe the effective adoption of agile requires passionate motivated individuals who accept change think like a business owner operate willingly outside team walls and identify and drive program issues finding such a large number of people with these qualities is much more difficult than establishing methods to support communications progress tracking and other agile practices we conclude by describing the attributes of the type of person that we believe will thrive in a large scale agile shop software development management team working agile practice software development agile tribe large scale agile shop computer architecture programming usa councils software testing service oriented architecture radiation detectors culture large scale agile recruiting,176,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

104,0,71,7,102,"ISRUP E-Service Framework for agile Enterprise Architecting Despite the fact that nowadays, architectures, development processes, frameworks and technologies are maturing to be service oriented architecture (SOA). Former frameworks for enterprise architecting couldn't be matched with those SOAs. Thus putting to use those frameworks to the business enterprises make IT/ICT consultants and enterprise architects encounter with some complex difficulties in the enterprise architecting projects. ISRUP e-service framework is proposed and developed based on SOA and RUP to converge e-business, e-commerce and e-government concepts through just leveraging e-services (especially Web and grid services) by architecting the information systems in the enterprises.

107,0,52,8,161,"Towards an Architectural Framework for Agile Software Development One of the ideas of agile software development is to respond to changes rather than following a plan. Constantly changing businesses result in changing requirements, to be handled in the development process. Therefore, it is essential that the underlying software architecture is capable of managing agile business processes. However, criticism on agile software development states that it lacks paying attention to architectural and design issues and therefore is bound to engender suboptimal design-decisions. In this paper we propose an architectural framework for agile software development, that by explicitly separating computational, coordinational, and communicational models offers a high degree of flexibility regarding architectural and design changes introduced by agile business processes. The framework strength is facilitated by combining the characteristics and properties of state-of-the-art middleware architectural styles captured in a simple API. The benefit of our approach is a clear architectural design with minimized effects of changes the models have on each other, accompanied by an efficient realization of new business requirements. application program interfaces, business data processing, middleware, software architecture, software prototyping, agile software development, software architecture, agile business processes, middleware architectural styles, API, Programming, Application software, Software architecture, Middleware, Variable speed drives, Logic, Systems engineering and theory, Space technology, Software systems, Conferences, Architectural Styles, Agile Business Requirements, Agile Software Development, Decoupling, Abstraction",towards an architectural framework for agile software development one of the ideas of agile software development is to respond to changes rather than following a plan constantly changing businesses result in changing requirements to be handled in the development process therefore it is essential that the underlying software architecture is capable of managing agile business processes however criticism on agile software development states that it lacks paying attention to architectural and design issues and therefore is bound to engender suboptimal design decisions in this paper we propose an architectural framework for agile software development that by explicitly separating computational coordinational and communicational models offers a high degree of flexibility regarding architectural and design changes introduced by agile business processes the framework strength is facilitated by combining the characteristics and properties of state of the art middleware architectural styles captured in a simple api the benefit of our approach is a clear architectural design with minimized effects of changes the models have on each other accompanied by an efficient realization of new business requirements application program interfaces business data processing middleware software architecture software prototyping agile software development software architecture agile business processes middleware architectural styles api programming application software software architecture middleware variable speed drives logic systems engineering and theory space technology software systems conferences architectural styles agile business requirements agile software development decoupling abstraction,225,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The analysis extracted 15 factors, each was associated with a list of practices. These factors with the associated practices can be used as a guide for agile process improvement. Correlations between the extracted factors were calculated, and the significant correlation findings suggested that people who applied iterative and incremental development and quality assurance practices had a high success rate, that communication with the customer was not very popular as it had negative correlations with governance and iterative and incremental development. Also, people who applied governance practices also applied quality assurance practices. Interestingly success rate related negatively with traditional analysis methods such as Gantt chart and detailed requirements specification. iterative methods, pattern clustering, software prototyping, factor analysis, agile practices clusters, agile process improvement, incremental development, iterative development, Gantt chart, Correlation, Quality assurance, Programming, Testing, Computer architecture, Databases, Organizations, agile software development, agile process improvement, empirical research, factor analysis, agile practices",using factor analysis to generate clusters of agile practices a guide for agile process improvement in this paper factor analysis is applied on a set of data that was collected to study the effectiveness of 58 different agile practices the analysis extracted 15 factors each was associated with a list of practices these factors with the associated practices can be used as a guide for agile process improvement correlations between the extracted factors were calculated and the significant correlation findings suggested that people who applied iterative and incremental development and quality assurance practices had a high success rate that communication with the customer was not very popular as it had negative correlations with governance and iterative and incremental development also people who applied governance practices also applied quality assurance practices interestingly success rate related negatively with traditional analysis methods such as gantt chart and detailed requirements specification iterative methods pattern clustering software prototyping factor analysis agile practices clusters agile process improvement incremental development iterative development gantt chart correlation quality assurance programming testing computer architecture databases organizations agile software development agile process improvement empirical research factor analysis agile practices,188,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
109,0,48,8,176,"Test-driven development for graphical UIs: A multi-platform toolset Test-driven development (TDD) is the practice of creating automated unit tests that exercise planned software functionality, before writing the software itself. TDD leads to higher quality software by encouraging developers to analyze individual units of behavior before coding and by allowing easy detection of problems introduced by software change. However, few tools effectively support TDD for graphical user interfaces. Those that do are platform-specific and require developers to express all tests as executable code for the target platform. This paper describes UIT (User Interface Tester), a toolset designed to support TDD for interactive applications. UIT addresses the weaknesses of existing solutions by using human-readable declarative test scripts and by generating skeleton GUIs from test scripts so that tests can be created first. It also supports driving GUIs that target different platforms. We present details of the scripting language, an overview of the UIT architecture with a focus on its multi-platform capabilities, and a discussion of current status and future plans. We believe that as UIT matures, it can assist developers in reaping the benefits of TDD. authoring languages, graphical user interfaces, software engineering, test driven development, graphical UI, multiplatform toolset, automated unit test, planned software functionality, TDD, software quality, graphical user interface, UIT, user interface tester, interactive application, human readable declarative test script, scripting language, Graphical user interfaces, Testing, Software, Containers, XML, Engines, Layout",test driven development for graphical uis a multi platform toolset test driven development tdd is the practice of creating automated unit tests that exercise planned software functionality before writing the software itself tdd leads to higher quality software by encouraging developers to analyze individual units of behavior before coding and by allowing easy detection of problems introduced by software change however few tools effectively support tdd for graphical user interfaces those that do are platform specific and require developers to express all tests as executable code for the target platform this paper describes uit user interface tester a toolset designed to support tdd for interactive applications uit addresses the weaknesses of existing solutions by using human readable declarative test scripts and by generating skeleton guis from test scripts so that tests can be created first it also supports driving guis that target different platforms we present details of the scripting language an overview of the uit architecture with a focus on its multi platform capabilities and a discussion of current status and future plans we believe that as uit matures it can assist developers in reaping the benefits of tdd authoring languages graphical user interfaces software engineering test driven development graphical ui multiplatform toolset automated unit test planned software functionality tdd software quality graphical user interface uit user interface tester interactive application human readable declarative test script scripting language graphical user interfaces testing software containers xml engines layout,238,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
110,0,82,8,163,"Bioremediation of historic architectural heritages by Sporosarcina pasteurii Laboratory experiments were conducted to protect and consolidate historic architectural heritages by bacterially induced carbonate mineralization forming a deposition layer on the surface of marble samples. Then, the effects of crystal phase and growth of the mineralized layer as well as the deposited crystal on the porosity of samples and on the efficiency of bonding and protection were analyzed by means of XRD, SEM, mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP) and ultrasonic test. Results show that the mineral crystal is composed of calcite and vaterite phases, that bacteria act as nucleation sites in the precipitation of the mineral crystal uniformly depositing on the sample surface, that the precipitation has no significant effect on the pore size distribution of samples rather than results in a porosity decrease by 22.2%, and that the mineral crystal strongly attaches the substratum. It is thus concluded that the bacterially-induced biomineralization is effective in remediating historic stone architectural heritages and can be an ecological and novel alternative to traditional techniques. architecture, biotechnology, building materials, crystal growth, ecology, history, microorganisms, minerals, nucleation, porosity, rocks, scanning electron microscopy, structural engineering, ultrasonic materials testing, X-ray diffraction, bioremediation, Sporosarcina pasteurii, laboratory experiment, carbonate mineralization, deposition layer, marble sample, crystal phase, crystal growth, mineralized layer, deposited crystal, porosity, bonding, XRD, SEM, mercury intrusion porosimeter, ultrasonic test, mineral crystal, calcite phase, vaterite phase, nucleation site, bacterially-induced biomineralization, historic stone architectural heritage, ecology, Microorganisms, Crystals, Mineralization, Scanning electron microscopy, Acoustics, Calcium, marble, calcium carbonate, Historic Architectural Heritages, biomineralization, bioremediation",bioremediation of historic architectural heritages by sporosarcina pasteurii laboratory experiments were conducted to protect and consolidate historic architectural heritages by bacterially induced carbonate mineralization forming a deposition layer on the surface of marble samples then the effects of crystal phase and growth of the mineralized layer as well as the deposited crystal on the porosity of samples and on the efficiency of bonding and protection were analyzed by means of xrd sem mercury intrusion porosimeter mip and ultrasonic test results show that the mineral crystal is composed of calcite and vaterite phases that bacteria act as nucleation sites in the precipitation of the mineral crystal uniformly depositing on the sample surface that the precipitation has no significant effect on the pore size distribution of samples rather than results in a porosity decrease by 22 2 and that the mineral crystal strongly attaches the substratum it is thus concluded that the bacterially induced biomineralization is effective in remediating historic stone architectural heritages and can be an ecological and novel alternative to traditional techniques architecture biotechnology building materials crystal growth ecology history microorganisms minerals nucleation porosity rocks scanning electron microscopy structural engineering ultrasonic materials testing x ray diffraction bioremediation sporosarcina pasteurii laboratory experiment carbonate mineralization deposition layer marble sample crystal phase crystal growth mineralized layer deposited crystal porosity bonding xrd sem mercury intrusion porosimeter ultrasonic test mineral crystal calcite phase vaterite phase nucleation site bacterially induced biomineralization historic stone architectural heritage ecology microorganisms crystals mineralization scanning electron microscopy acoustics calcium marble calcium carbonate historic architectural heritages biomineralization bioremediation,256,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

113,0,44,7,139,"Agile process tailoring and problem analysis (APTLY) Developing software using a well-defined, well-understood process improves the likelihood of delivering a product with the required quality. Enhancing that process to meet recognised process standards, such as CMMI and ISO 9000, can further facilitate the development of complex systems in a repeatable and predictable way. There are tradeoffs involved, however. In particular, because projects differ in their scale, scope, and technical challenge, the same process will not suit all circumstances. Agile approaches to development, such as Extreme Programming (XP), SCRUM and Crystal Methodologies, recognise this dilemma and suggest that processes be tailored to each situation. The research problem for postgraduate investigation is to determine in detail how this can be achieved successfully. This will include a consideration of how best to define, maintain and give access to a knowledge base recording details of process concepts, techniques and experience. software architecture, software process improvement, software quality, software standards, agile process tailoring, problem analysis, software development, process standards, CMMI, ISO 9000, extreme programming, XP, SCRUM, Crystal Methodologies, Quality management, Information analysis, Software quality, ISO standards, Standards development, Best practices, Programming, Process design, Monitoring, SPICE",agile process tailoring and problem analysis aptly developing software using a well defined well understood process improves the likelihood of delivering a product with the required quality enhancing that process to meet recognised process standards such as cmmi and iso 9000 can further facilitate the development of complex systems in a repeatable and predictable way there are tradeoffs involved however in particular because projects differ in their scale scope and technical challenge the same process will not suit all circumstances agile approaches to development such as extreme programming xp scrum and crystal methodologies recognise this dilemma and suggest that processes be tailored to each situation the research problem for postgraduate investigation is to determine in detail how this can be achieved successfully this will include a consideration of how best to define maintain and give access to a knowledge base recording details of process concepts techniques and experience software architecture software process improvement software quality software standards agile process tailoring problem analysis software development process standards cmmi iso 9000 extreme programming xp scrum crystal methodologies quality management information analysis software quality iso standards standards development best practices programming process design monitoring spice,192,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Agile methods can achieve a high level of satisfaction among all project stakeholders (users, customers, business managers, developers, and project managers) in terms of productivity, product quality, cost containment, time-to-market, and overall morale. Success with agile requires focus on requirements and design as a continuous discovery process, posing challenges for practitioners of more traditional project management both in terms of method adoption and sustained commitment. Thriving Systems Theory clarifies the appeal of agile project structure and processes, helps project teams determine and achieve the optimal portfolio of quality characteristics, and better articulate their value to all stakeholders. Thriving Systems Theory is an emerging framework of systems design quality that translates the research of design pattern patriarch Christopher Alexander on physical architecture design quality into the domain of systems engineering. The satisfaction achieved through agile methods is explained by Thriving Systems Theory's fifteen choice properties of systems design quality.

115,0,41,5,187,"Service Agile Development Using XP System development using a Service-Oriented Architecture approach encompasses new roles and tasks as opposed to traditional development. It brings new challenges in different aspects, such as: reuse, flexibility, stakeholders' involvement, business understanding. Considering methods for system development, those aspects are handled by agile methods. However, there is no consensus on how to use agile methods in service-oriented system development. Agile methods can be used in different phases of a software development lifecycle, such as: project management, modeling, software construction, software testing. Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the methods more closely related to the construction phase. XP is widely adopted in the industry and offers practices that can be applied to several business contexts. The goal of this work is to propose guidelines and best practices towards service development, focused on the construction phase, in an SOA environment using XP. It goes towards the identification of the shared concerns and the gaps between SOA and XP practices and, additionally, presents open issues and main challenges to be considered when incrementally constructing service solutions with continuous feedback and flexibility to rapidly develop services that meet changing business requirements. program testing, service-oriented architecture, software prototyping, service agile development, XP, service-oriented architecture, service-oriented system development, software development lifecycle, project management, software construction, software testing, Extreme Programming, Service-oriented architecture, Semiconductor optical amplifiers, Contracts, Complexity theory, Programming, SOA, Extreme Programming, Service Development Methods",service agile development using xp system development using a service oriented architecture approach encompasses new roles and tasks as opposed to traditional development it brings new challenges in different aspects such as reuse flexibility stakeholders involvement business understanding considering methods for system development those aspects are handled by agile methods however there is no consensus on how to use agile methods in service oriented system development agile methods can be used in different phases of a software development lifecycle such as project management modeling software construction software testing extreme programming xp is one of the methods more closely related to the construction phase xp is widely adopted in the industry and offers practices that can be applied to several business contexts the goal of this work is to propose guidelines and best practices towards service development focused on the construction phase in an soa environment using xp it goes towards the identification of the shared concerns and the gaps between soa and xp practices and additionally presents open issues and main challenges to be considered when incrementally constructing service solutions with continuous feedback and flexibility to rapidly develop services that meet changing business requirements program testing service oriented architecture software prototyping service agile development xp service oriented architecture service oriented system development software development lifecycle project management software construction software testing extreme programming service oriented architecture semiconductor optical amplifiers contracts complexity theory programming soa extreme programming service development methods,239,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

119,0,42,19,151,"Service Oriented Architecture: Making the Leap, Leveraging Model Driven Architecture and Achieving Software Agility with BPM, SOA and MDA® It seems that service oriented architecture (SOA) is to be this year's hot buzzword, rather than a well defined, meaningful and valuable part of the Enterprise Architecture landscape. Before the term fades away completely, perhaps we should agree what's valuable about the move to SOA and how to make the leap, and make the leap valuable. The SOA consortium is making great strides in defining SOA to be a valuable business strategy for business agility, in the context of Enterprise Architecture, Business Process Management and other concepts; and the Object Management Group (OMG) is making headway on modeling standards for services (as opposed to yet another set of standards for moving bits around wires). Dr. Soley will introduce the SOA Consortium and give some context for OMG's work in service modeling, with a focus on early successes in implementing the SOA business strategy leveraging modeling technologies like UML, BPMN and MOF. business data processing, object-oriented programming, software architecture, service oriented architecture, model driven architecture, enterprise architecture, business process management, object management group, Service oriented architecture, Computer architecture, Business communication, Application software, Software engineering, Conference management, Engineering management, Software standards, Context-aware services, Context modeling",service oriented architecture making the leap leveraging model driven architecture and achieving software agility with bpm soa and mda it seems that service oriented architecture soa is to be this year s hot buzzword rather than a well defined meaningful and valuable part of the enterprise architecture landscape before the term fades away completely perhaps we should agree what s valuable about the move to soa and how to make the leap and make the leap valuable the soa consortium is making great strides in defining soa to be a valuable business strategy for business agility in the context of enterprise architecture business process management and other concepts and the object management group omg is making headway on modeling standards for services as opposed to yet another set of standards for moving bits around wires dr soley will introduce the soa consortium and give some context for omg s work in service modeling with a focus on early successes in implementing the soa business strategy leveraging modeling technologies like uml bpmn and mof business data processing object oriented programming software architecture service oriented architecture model driven architecture enterprise architecture business process management object management group service oriented architecture computer architecture business communication application software software engineering conference management engineering management software standards context aware services context modeling,217,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

When the problem is more complex and the team size is bigger, organization of team, project and product became to have more relevance. Architecture practices deal with these concerns, so these are key elements for achieving any scalable XP extension. In this paper we propose XA (XP with Architecture), an XP extension including adapted architecture practices from architecture centered approaches.

121,0,128,8,314,"Service Oriented Architecture for agile automated testing environment System test development, automation and execution process are key stages of the overall product development to both the New Product Introduction (NPI) and Production Release processes. For NPI, companies must create test systems to support product validation and verification. For manufacturing companies, ongoing process metrics are used to ensure the product meets quality specifications and can be sold to customers. This entire test process is time consuming and resource intensive and therefore negatively impacts the overall product net revenue, both in terms of time to market and in terms of development resources. Large and successful companies invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in automated test systems to support product development. Such infrastructures provide a competitive advantage by enabling a systematic methodology to generate test plans and then automatically have the test plan flow through the test software and hardware development, test and data collection, and results analysis phases. The Automatic Testing Equipment (ATE) industry has pushed to develop a framework that supports the sharing of test information, data, and analysis results across various enterprise platforms. An IEEE standard know as Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML), comprising of an XML schema, was proposed and developed in order to allow interoperability of test case, data, equipment information, and results. Our methodology provides a Service-Oriented Architecture that provides an interoperable solution. Users can begin with a test plan, deploy a scalable data monitoring and analysis capability, and follow the process from NPI through production. Various additional capabilities such as advanced analysis capability, customer data sharing resources, test software generation and deployment, closed and open source software library access, test station monitoring and equipment tracking, automated reporting schedules, and others are among the possibilities that can be added to the overall process. The proposed architecture is entirely scalable and can be deployed in single-site or global applications and may be installed behind corporate firewalls or in the cloud. agile manufacturing, automatic

122,0,66,8,144,"Use of Agile Methods in Software Engineering Education The use of contemporary software development approaches such as agile methods is growing in widespread use throughout the world. Although some universities are starting to teach them, courses on agile methods at the undergraduate and graduate levels are still a new phenomenon. The University of Maryland University College (UMUC) adapted agile methods for its capstone course towards a masterpsilas degree in software engineering in the Fall of 2008. Three distributed teams of five students were asked to use agile methods to build competing electronic commerce Web sites. With little training in agile methods, virtual teams, collaboration tools, or Web design, each of the three teams completed fully functional e-commerce Web sites using agile methods in little more than 13 weeks. Teams who struck an optimum balance of customer collaboration, use of agile methods, and technical programming ability had better productivity and Web site quality. computer science education, educational courses, electronic commerce, software engineering, teaching, Web design, agile method, software engineering education, contemporary software development approach, teaching, capstone course, electronic commerce Web site, virtual team, collaboration tool, Web design, Software engineering, Educational institutions, Programming profession, Computer industry, Service oriented architecture, Software standards, Military computing, Dynamic programming, Testing, Electronic commerce, Agile Methods, Software Engineering, Education, Software Development, Computer Programming, Scrum, Extreme Programming",use of agile methods in software engineering education the use of contemporary software development approaches such as agile methods is growing in widespread use throughout the world although some universities are starting to teach them courses on agile methods at the undergraduate and graduate levels are still a new phenomenon the university of maryland university college umuc adapted agile methods for its capstone course towards a masterpsilas degree in software engineering in the fall of 2008 three distributed teams of five students were asked to use agile methods to build competing electronic commerce web sites with little training in agile methods virtual teams collaboration tools or web design each of the three teams completed fully functional e commerce web sites using agile methods in little more than 13 weeks teams who struck an optimum balance of customer collaboration use of agile methods and technical programming ability had better productivity and web site quality computer science education educational courses electronic commerce software engineering teaching web design agile method software engineering education contemporary software development approach teaching capstone course electronic commerce web site virtual team collaboration tool web design software engineering educational institutions programming profession computer industry service oriented architecture software standards military computing dynamic programming testing electronic commerce agile methods software engineering education software development computer programming scrum extreme programming,219,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
123,0,42,7,195,"Agile vs. plan-driven perceptions of software architecture The use of agile methodologies in industry has increased significantly over the past decade, promoting the value of human-centric software development process. This growing use derives the need to adjust agile methodologies to bigger, more complex system development projects, where architecture plays a significant role. However, many believe that an essential conflict exists between the requirement of minimalism in agile methods and the need for well-defined and documented architecture in complex systems. This paper presents an exploratory study aimed at understanding the software architecture related activities as perceived by architects with and without experience in agile methodologies. The findings indicate that while architects practicing only plan-driven methodologies perceive architecture activities as being related only to the first phases of the development process, architects involved in agile projects perceive architecture activities to be related to most or all phases of the development lifecycle. The latter perceptions are consistent with suggestions expressed in the literature regarding architecture in general and in agile methodologies in particular. Based on these findings we suggest that agile methods not only lead architects to adjust their behavior to the agile philosophy, but also improve architects' perceptions and practice of architecture in general. software architecture, software prototyping, plan-driven perceptions, agile methodologies, software architecture, human-centric software development process, complex system development projects, agile projects perceive architecture activities, agile philosophy, Computer architecture, Software architecture, Conferences, Software, Testing, Documentation, Programming, software architecture, development methodologies, agile methodology, qualitative research",agile vs plan driven perceptions of software architecture the use of agile methodologies in industry has increased significantly over the past decade promoting the value of human centric software development process this growing use derives the need to adjust agile methodologies to bigger more complex system development projects where architecture plays a significant role however many believe that an essential conflict exists between the requirement of minimalism in agile methods and the need for well defined and documented architecture in complex systems this paper presents an exploratory study aimed at understanding the software architecture related activities as perceived by architects with and without experience in agile methodologies the findings indicate that while architects practicing only plan driven methodologies perceive architecture activities as being related only to the first phases of the development process architects involved in agile projects perceive architecture activities to be related to most or all phases of the development lifecycle the latter perceptions are consistent with suggestions expressed in the literature regarding architecture in general and in agile methodologies in particular based on these findings we suggest that agile methods not only lead architects to adjust their behavior to the agile philosophy but also improve architects perceptions and practice of architecture in general software architecture software prototyping plan driven perceptions agile methodologies software architecture human centric software development process complex system development projects agile projects perceive architecture activities agile philosophy computer architecture software architecture conferences software testing documentation programming software architecture development methodologies agile methodology qualitative research,250,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Modern systems engineering problems (specifically within the defense domain) are faced with an evolutionary operational deployment environment in which the problems the initial CONOPS sets out to address often evolve to areas that the system under design falls short of addressing, or misses altogether. As the operational mission for modern day systems is non-static, the engineering solutions must be sufficiently adaptive and evolutionary to meet these emerging challenges.

125,0,41,12,211,"A Non-invasive Approach to Trace Architecture Design, Requirements Specification and Agile Artifacts Agile processes emphasize iterative delivery rather than assuming the definition of all detailed requirements and architecture up front. This ""just enough"" approach generally considers user stories and acceptance tests as sufficient documentation for successful system development. However, industry practices have shown that this minimalism is appropriate for projects with short duration and small collocated teams. In the development of large systems, the ""just enough"" documentation goes beyond the traditional set recommended by the Agile evangelists, due to the diversity of elements to be considered, as for instance geographic distribution of the teams, necessity to comply with industry regulations, strict IT governance programs, integration of the system being developed with others, or even the presence of not-so-agile people in the teams. In this context, a more complex set of artifacts is required to ensure the proper development of systems, such as more detailed requirements documents and architectural specification. In this regard, to support the agile development of large systems, we introduce TraceMan - Traceability Manager as a mechanism for ensuring traceability among user stories, traditional requirements documents, test specifications, architecture design, and source code. We also present an experience report on how TraceMan has been used in the daily activities at John Deere Intelligent Solutions Group (ISG) to support traceability among development artifacts. formal specification, software architecture, software prototyping, architecture design, requirements specification, agile artifacts, architectural specification, large system agile development, TraceMan, traceability manager, Intelligent Solutions Group, ISG, Computer architecture, Documentation, Agricultural machinery, Software, Context, Industries, Testing, Agile Development, Traceability, Architecture, Requirements, Agile Artifacts",a non invasive approach to trace architecture design requirements specification and agile artifacts agile processes emphasize iterative delivery rather than assuming the definition of all detailed requirements and architecture up front this just enough approach generally considers user stories and acceptance tests as sufficient documentation for successful system development however industry practices have shown that this minimalism is appropriate for projects with short duration and small collocated teams in the development of large systems the just enough documentation goes beyond the traditional set recommended by the agile evangelists due to the diversity of elements to be considered as for instance geographic distribution of the teams necessity to comply with industry regulations strict it governance programs integration of the system being developed with others or even the presence of not so agile people in the teams in this context a more complex set of artifacts is required to ensure the proper development of systems such as more detailed requirements documents and architectural specification in this regard to support the agile development of large systems we introduce traceman traceability manager as a mechanism for ensuring traceability among user stories traditional requirements documents test specifications architecture design and source code we also present an experience report on how traceman has been used in the daily activities at john deere intelligent solutions group isg to support traceability among development artifacts formal specification software architecture software prototyping architecture design requirements specification agile artifacts architectural specification large system agile development traceman traceability manager intelligent solutions group isg computer architecture documentation agricultural machinery software context industries testing agile development traceability architecture requirements agile artifacts,267,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

128,0,112,9,213,"A Frequency-Agile RF Frontend Architecture for Multi-Band TDD Applications Emerging wireless standards specify dozens of bands spanning several octaves, which need to be supported in form-factor and energy constrained mobile devices targeting ubiquitous connectivity. However, in current multi-band radio implementations, significant redundancy is still the norm in the RF frontend. This work introduces an improved architecture for multi-band, time-division duplexed (TDD) radios, which replaces multiple narrowband frontend components with a frequency-agile solution, tunable over a wide frequency range. A highly digital architecture is adopted, leading to a fully integrated solution wherein both efficiency and achievable frequency range benefit from CMOS scaling. A prototype is integrated in 45 nm SOI CMOS. Peak PA output power is 27.7 $\pm$0.5 dBm from 1.3 to 3.3 GHz, with up to 30% total efficiency at 2 V.

129,0,27,8,184,"What Does Research Say about Agile and Architecture? Agile has been used to refer to a software development paradigm that emphasizes rapid and flexible development. In the meanwhile, we have through our practical experiences in scaling up agile methods, noticed that architecture plays an important role. Due to the inter-relationship between agile methods and architecture, as well as divergent perceptions on their correlation stated in numerous sources, we are motivated to find out how these perceptions are supported by findings in the research community in general and in empirical studies in particular. To fully benefit from agile practices and architectural disciplines, we need empirical data on the perceived and experienced impacts of introducing agile methods to existing software development process, as well as correlations between agile and architecture. In this paper, we survey the research literature for statements made regarding the relationship between agile development and software architecture. The main findings are that there is a lack of scientific support for many of the claims that are concerned with agile and architecture, and more empirical studies are needed to fully reveal the benefits and drawbacks implied by an agile software development method. software architecture, software prototyping, software development, rapid development, flexible development, agile development, software architecture, Computer architecture, Software architecture, Programming, Software, Data mining, Conferences, Agile, Agile methodology, Architecture",what does research say about agile and architecture agile has been used to refer to a software development paradigm that emphasizes rapid and flexible development in the meanwhile we have through our practical experiences in scaling up agile methods noticed that architecture plays an important role due to the inter relationship between agile methods and architecture as well as divergent perceptions on their correlation stated in numerous sources we are motivated to find out how these perceptions are supported by findings in the research community in general and in empirical studies in particular to fully benefit from agile practices and architectural disciplines we need empirical data on the perceived and experienced impacts of introducing agile methods to existing software development process as well as correlations between agile and architecture in this paper we survey the research literature for statements made regarding the relationship between agile development and software architecture the main findings are that there is a lack of scientific support for many of the claims that are concerned with agile and architecture and more empirical studies are needed to fully reveal the benefits and drawbacks implied by an agile software development method software architecture software prototyping software development rapid development flexible development agile development software architecture computer architecture software architecture programming software data mining conferences agile agile methodology architecture,220,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

131,0,45,14,136,"Multi-agent-based architecture and mechanism for coordination and execution in agile supply chain operational management Although previous studies have achieved a great deal on the local decision areas including inventory policies, vendor selection, production scheduling, etc., and the strategic problems, e.g. networks design, simulation and prediction of the supply chain as a whole, few attempts have been focused on the integrated solution for supply chain operational management. As the structure of multi-agent systems (MAS) inherently meets the requirements of autonomy and decentralization for supply chains, we propose a multi-agent-based model of planning, scheduling and execution that is capable of supporting the resource coordination between the self-interested agents through a combinatorial auction mechanism. And a general framework of ASCMS (agile supply chain management system) is presented as the background. To facilitate the functions of this system, the components of various agents and the negotiation process are also discussed in this paper. multi-agent systems, supply chain management, strategic planning, scheduling, agile manufacturing, multiagent systems, resource coordination, combinatorial auction mechanism, agile supply chain operational management system, Supply chains, Supply chain management, Computer architecture, Manufacturing automation, Production, Job shop scheduling, Multiagent systems, Agile manufacturing, Engineering management, Computer integrated manufacturing",multi agent based architecture and mechanism for coordination and execution in agile supply chain operational management although previous studies have achieved a great deal on the local decision areas including inventory policies vendor selection production scheduling etc and the strategic problems e g networks design simulation and prediction of the supply chain as a whole few attempts have been focused on the integrated solution for supply chain operational management as the structure of multi agent systems mas inherently meets the requirements of autonomy and decentralization for supply chains we propose a multi agent based model of planning scheduling and execution that is capable of supporting the resource coordination between the self interested agents through a combinatorial auction mechanism and a general framework of ascms agile supply chain management system is presented as the background to facilitate the functions of this system the components of various agents and the negotiation process are also discussed in this paper multi agent systems supply chain management strategic planning scheduling agile manufacturing multiagent systems resource coordination combinatorial auction mechanism agile supply chain operational management system supply chains supply chain management computer architecture manufacturing automation production job shop scheduling multiagent systems agile manufacturing engineering management computer integrated manufacturing,202,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Those practices resulted in sprint reviews where no functionality could be demonstrated to the users and several iterations before all of the pieces were working together with useful functionality to show to users. Those habits continued when the next wave of projects with user interfaces came along. In this paper, we highlight the stories of four of our agile teams who tried vertical slicing, the challenges they faced, the victories, and the lessons learned. program slicing, software prototyping, user interfaces, vertical slicing, agile software development, user interfaces, Business, Buildings, Production, Data models, User interfaces, Media, Service oriented architecture",vertical slicing smaller is better the technique of vertical slicing was introduced as a mechanism to combat our agile software development teams developing tendency toward building software in horizontal layers building one service at a time or grouping stories then breaking them down into layers those practices resulted in sprint reviews where no functionality could be demonstrated to the users and several iterations before all of the pieces were working together with useful functionality to show to users those habits continued when the next wave of projects with user interfaces came along in this paper we highlight the stories of four of our agile teams who tried vertical slicing the challenges they faced the victories and the lessons learned program slicing software prototyping user interfaces vertical slicing agile software development user interfaces business buildings production data models user interfaces media service oriented architecture,143,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This complexity emerges from the higher degree of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve and from the evolution of the functionalities implemented by the applications. The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), a document review investigation has taken place with the objective to compare SOA development with two highly used agile software development methods: Extreme Programming (XP) and Relational Unified Process (RUP). The motor behind this investigation is to see if this agile development methods are capable enough to design effectively and efficiently SOA type applications. The investigation concluded that both methodologies are not exactly suited to create SOA applications, but RUP has a greater chance to provide SOA type applications if the proper adjustments are made, specially on the design side of the methodology. project management, service-oriented architecture, software prototyping, rational unified process, service oriented application, extreme programming, software development project complexity, service oriented architecture, document review investigation, SOA development, agile software development methods, XP, relational unified process, RUP, Service-oriented architecture, Semiconductor optical amplifiers, Business, Documentation, Programming, Computer architecture, Service Oriented Architecture, Software Development Methods, Extreme Programming, Relational Unified Process (RUP)",rational unified process for service oriented application in extreme programming in the last decades the complexity of software development projects had a significant increase this complexity emerges from the higher degree of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve and from the evolution of the functionalities implemented by the applications the service oriented architecture soa a document review investigation has taken place with the objective to compare soa development with two highly used agile software development methods extreme programming xp and relational unified process rup the motor behind this investigation is to see if this agile development methods are capable enough to design effectively and efficiently soa type applications the investigation concluded that both methodologies are not exactly suited to create soa applications but rup has a greater chance to provide soa type applications if the proper adjustments are made specially on the design side of the methodology project management service oriented architecture software prototyping rational unified process service oriented application extreme programming software development project complexity service oriented architecture document review investigation soa development agile software development methods xp relational unified process rup service oriented architecture semiconductor optical amplifiers business documentation programming computer architecture service oriented architecture software development methods extreme programming relational unified process rup,208,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
134,0,54,10,139,"Agile Development of Platform Independent Model in Model Driven Architecture Along with the growing software market in recent years, business requirements are changing more rapidly and the complexity of enterprise applications is growing continuously. An ideal goal is to encapsulate these requirements into a high-level abstraction, which can be used to drive large-scale adaptation of the underlying software implementation. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is one of the enabling techniques that support this objective. One of the important parts in this process is the creation of Platform Independent Model (PIM). There are several approaches on this matter. However there is still the absence of clear documentation on the methods especially when the purpose is aimed for generic PIMs in a specific domain. This article introduces an approach to developing PIMs by using UML, OCL and promotes agility by applying agile modeling for this purpose. A practical example will be demonstrated. software architecture, Unified Modeling Language, agile development, platform independent model, model driven architecture, business requirements, enterprise applications, high-level abstraction, model driven engineering, Unified Modeling Language, Object Constraint Language, Model driven engineering, Unified modeling language, Computer science, Process design, Weaving, Computer architecture, Application software, Large-scale systems, Documentation, User interfaces, Agile modeling, MDD, OCL, PIM, UML",agile development of platform independent model in model driven architecture along with the growing software market in recent years business requirements are changing more rapidly and the complexity of enterprise applications is growing continuously an ideal goal is to encapsulate these requirements into a high level abstraction which can be used to drive large scale adaptation of the underlying software implementation model driven engineering mde is one of the enabling techniques that support this objective one of the important parts in this process is the creation of platform independent model pim there are several approaches on this matter however there is still the absence of clear documentation on the methods especially when the purpose is aimed for generic pims in a specific domain this article introduces an approach to developing pims by using uml ocl and promotes agility by applying agile modeling for this purpose a practical example will be demonstrated software architecture unified modeling language agile development platform independent model model driven architecture business requirements enterprise applications high level abstraction model driven engineering unified modeling language object constraint language model driven engineering unified modeling language computer science process design weaving computer architecture application software large scale systems documentation user interfaces agile modeling mdd ocl pim uml,207,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

136,0,43,6,148,"Guiding Flexibility Investment in Agile Architecting Agile software development pursues to deal with continuous change. But software product architectures without enough flexibility can restrict how products cope with change. However, designing for flexibility often entails high costs and risk that comes with the assumption that change will happen. Actually, in software architecture the flexibility investment decision making problem has become challenging. This paper presents a process to assist architects in Making decisions about Flexibility investment in Software Architecture (MAKE Flexi). MAKE Flexi is based on technical debt and real options approaches. Technical debt allows for estimating the additional cost derived from the lack of flexibility in software architectures, whereas the real options valuation allows for estimating the value of the flexibility that a design option could provide. MAKE Flexi has been applied to an industry project for smart grids to assist architects in making decisions about designing for flexibility to vary data storage technologies. decision making, software architecture, software prototyping, storage management, guiding flexibility investment, agile architecting, agile software development, software product architectures, decision making, MAKE Flexi, data storage technologies, Investment, Software, Computer architecture, Software architecture, Decision trees, Cost accounting, Estimation, agile, architecture, technical debt, real options",guiding flexibility investment in agile architecting agile software development pursues to deal with continuous change but software product architectures without enough flexibility can restrict how products cope with change however designing for flexibility often entails high costs and risk that comes with the assumption that change will happen actually in software architecture the flexibility investment decision making problem has become challenging this paper presents a process to assist architects in making decisions about flexibility investment in software architecture make flexi make flexi is based on technical debt and real options approaches technical debt allows for estimating the additional cost derived from the lack of flexibility in software architectures whereas the real options valuation allows for estimating the value of the flexibility that a design option could provide make flexi has been applied to an industry project for smart grids to assist architects in making decisions about designing for flexibility to vary data storage technologies decision making software architecture software prototyping storage management guiding flexibility investment agile architecting agile software development software product architectures decision making make flexi data storage technologies investment software computer architecture software architecture decision trees cost accounting estimation agile architecture technical debt real options,197,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
137,0,78,14,353,"Common Business Components and Services toward More Agile and Flexible Industry Solutions and Assets Summary form only given. In many decades, many organizations, especially large consulting companies, have been designing, implementing and managing business solutions for every industry around the globe. But due to numerous limitations in process, tooling and skills, most of those solutions were made very specific to individual industry and client needs at its early design stage. Therefore, reuse and more importantly, managing the ever changing business requirements, become almost impossible. Service-orientation and architecture, model-driven business development provides us a new and powerful approach to facilitate asset based industry solution design and development. To further accelerate this, this tutorial discusses about an innovative approach that take advantage of many proven best software engineering practices, from object/component based technology, meta-data driven architecture types (archetypes) that are used to model the common structural and in some cases non-structural business entities such as customer, product, payment, etc. In order to address the consequences introduced by abstracting those common elements out of the specific industry model and be able to enable easy and meta-data based transformation, we properly decompose business components/services into a multi-layered business architecture. Therefore, process/components/services can be decomposed accordingly to facilitate the decomposition and abstraction, while maintaining certain level of necessary traceability across various artifacts. In the realization phase, existing assets/operational systems will be mapped and transformed to the required business components and services to best leverage those existing valuable industry/client investments. To support such a SOA based, model and business driven development process, existing tooling, especially the necessary transformation and integration capability, needs to be significantly enhanced. This tutorial will also present some recommendation based on some recent design and implementation, and they could be used to guide future tooling alignment and integration effort across software modeling, implementation and solution products. In addition, we will present how to leverage existing internal or external assets or product offerings and the open industry reference models and standards (such as ACCORD, ebXML, ARTS/IxRetail).

138,0,70,15,194,"Documentation Work in Agile Teams: The Role of Documentation Formalism in Achieving a Sustainable Practice As its second guiding principle, agile software development promotes working software over comprehensive documentation. In this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development. We report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams. 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups: SAD and UML. Group SAD was to update and deliver their high-level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by RUP templates. Group UML was instructed to update and deliver their low-level software design in form of UML models. Our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation. We found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members. Consequently, this hampered collaboration within the team. Based in our findings, we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project, producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product. Furthermore, we argue that codification of internal development knowledge should be a non-intrusive task. software architecture, software prototyping, sustainable development, system documentation, Unified Modeling Language, documentation work, agile teams, documentation formalism role, sustainable practice, agile software development, iterative documentation practices, SAD group, UML group, high-level software architecture, textual description, RUP templates, low-level software design, textual documentation, task specialization, documentation allocation, Documentation, Unified modeling language, Encoding, Teamwork, Software architecture, Software design, agile teams, software development, knowledge sharing, project management, organizational management and coordination, process improvement",documentation work in agile teams the role of documentation formalism in achieving a sustainable practice as its second guiding principle agile software development promotes working software over comprehensive documentation in this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development we report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups sad and uml group sad was to update and deliver their high level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by rup templates group uml was instructed to update and deliver their low level software design in form of uml models our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation we found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members consequently this hampered collaboration within the team based in our findings we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product furthermore we argue that codification of internal development knowledge should be a non intrusive task software architecture software prototyping sustainable development system documentation unified modeling language documentation work agile teams documentation formalism role sustainable practice agile software development iterative documentation practices sad group uml group high level software architecture textual description rup templates low level software design textual documentation task specialization documentation allocation documentation unified modeling language encoding teamwork software architecture software design agile teams software development knowledge sharing project management organizational management and coordination process improvement,284,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

This raises the question of how to develop systems in ways that can best leverage the perspectives, practices, and knowledge bases of these different areas. Agile software development and usability engineering both address important aspects of system design, but there are tensions between the methods that make them difficult to integrate. This work presents a development approach that draws from extreme programming (XP), a widely practiced agile software development process, and scenario-based design (SBD), an established usability engineering process. It describes three key questions that need to be addressed for agile software development methods and usability engineering practices to work together effectively, and it introduces interface architectures and design representations that can address these questions. software engineering, usable software, agile software development, usability engineering, extreme programming, scenario-based design, interface architectures, design representations, Usability, Programming, Design engineering, Process design, Computer architecture, Software systems, Computer science, Best practices, Surges, Probes",towards extreme ly usable software exploring tensions between usability and agile software development design is an inherently multidisciplinary endeavor this raises the question of how to develop systems in ways that can best leverage the perspectives practices and knowledge bases of these different areas agile software development and usability engineering both address important aspects of system design but there are tensions between the methods that make them difficult to integrate this work presents a development approach that draws from extreme programming xp a widely practiced agile software development process and scenario based design sbd an established usability engineering process it describes three key questions that need to be addressed for agile software development methods and usability engineering practices to work together effectively and it introduces interface architectures and design representations that can address these questions software engineering usable software agile software development usability engineering extreme programming scenario based design interface architectures design representations usability programming design engineering process design computer architecture software systems computer science best practices surges probes,169,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
140,0,69,21,97,"A Novel Architectural Design Model for Enterprise Systems: Evaluating Enterprise Resource Planning System and Enterprise Application Integration Against Service Oriented Architecture This paper describes a novel architectural design model for implementing enterprise systems with the aid of service oriented architecture (SOA). It addresses the organizational challenges in enabling cross communication and collaboration without changing the current ICT infrastructure. Organizations in today's market require a dynamic system that synchronizes not only their supply chain, but also their business processes. The proposed novel approach represents an agile and flexible technology framework based on Service oriented architecture (SOA). The authors demonstrate the utility of the approach by implementing a solution to integrate the customer relationship Manager (CRM) and stock control system. customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, software architecture, stock control, supply chain management, novel architectural design model, enterprise systems, enterprise resource planning system, enterprise application integration, service oriented architecture, supply chain, customer relationship manager, stock control system, Enterprise resource planning, Service oriented architecture, Object oriented modeling, Application software, Collaboration, Supply chains, Customer relationship management, Globalization, Business communication, Humans, Enterprise Resource Planning, Enterprise Application Integration, Service Oriented Architecture, Enterprise Systems",a novel architectural design model for enterprise systems evaluating enterprise resource planning system and enterprise application integration against service oriented architecture this paper describes a novel architectural design model for implementing enterprise systems with the aid of service oriented architecture soa it addresses the organizational challenges in enabling cross communication and collaboration without changing the current ict infrastructure organizations in today s market require a dynamic system that synchronizes not only their supply chain but also their business processes the proposed novel approach represents an agile and flexible technology framework based on service oriented architecture soa the authors demonstrate the utility of the approach by implementing a solution to integrate the customer relationship manager crm and stock control system customer relationship management enterprise resource planning software architecture stock control supply chain management novel architectural design model enterprise systems enterprise resource planning system enterprise application integration service oriented architecture supply chain customer relationship manager stock control system enterprise resource planning service oriented architecture object oriented modeling application software collaboration supply chains customer relationship management globalization business communication humans enterprise resource planning enterprise application integration service oriented architecture enterprise systems,188,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

143,0,72,13,155,"Elaboration on an integrated architecture and requirement practice: Prototyping with quality attribute focus This experience report builds on an earlier study in which we interviewed eight project teams that were using iterative incremental lifecycles. In the study, we captured the practices the teams felt contributed to rapid delivery. We identified a mix of Agile and architecture practices that teams apply to rapidly field software and minimize disruption and delay. In this paper, we elaborate one practice from the study, prototyping with quality attribute focus. We compared two experiences in prototyping focused on quality attribute considerations applied on Scrum projects. We observe through interviews that feature development and prototyping practice spans multiple levels: feature development/sprint, release planning, and portfolio planning. We also observe other factors including rapid trade-off analysis, flexible architecture, and adoption of a set of enabling prototyping guidelines. The analysis of the observations sheds light on several aspects of the practice that enable the team to respond quickly and efficiently when prototype feedback suggests architectural change. project management, software architecture, software development management, software prototyping, software quality, prototype feedback, prototyping guidelines, flexible architecture, rapid trade-off analysis, release planning, portfolio planning, prototyping practice spans, feature development, Scrum projects, prototyping with quality attribute focus, architecture practices, agile practices, iterative incremental lifecycles, project teams, requirement practice, integrated architecture, Prototypes, Computer architecture, Planning, Guidelines, Interviews, Software, Delays, agile software development, architecture, quality attribute, prototyping, release planning, requirements, software development practices, architecture trade-off",elaboration on an integrated architecture and requirement practice prototyping with quality attribute focus this experience report builds on an earlier study in which we interviewed eight project teams that were using iterative incremental lifecycles in the study we captured the practices the teams felt contributed to rapid delivery we identified a mix of agile and architecture practices that teams apply to rapidly field software and minimize disruption and delay in this paper we elaborate one practice from the study prototyping with quality attribute focus we compared two experiences in prototyping focused on quality attribute considerations applied on scrum projects we observe through interviews that feature development and prototyping practice spans multiple levels feature development sprint release planning and portfolio planning we also observe other factors including rapid trade off analysis flexible architecture and adoption of a set of enabling prototyping guidelines the analysis of the observations sheds light on several aspects of the practice that enable the team to respond quickly and efficiently when prototype feedback suggests architectural change project management software architecture software development management software prototyping software quality prototype feedback prototyping guidelines flexible architecture rapid trade off analysis release planning portfolio planning prototyping practice spans feature development scrum projects prototyping with quality attribute focus architecture practices agile practices iterative incremental lifecycles project teams requirement practice integrated architecture prototypes computer architecture planning guidelines interviews software delays agile software development architecture quality attribute prototyping release planning requirements software development practices architecture trade off,243,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Based on a large-scale empirical study involving 102 practitioners who had worked with agile and architecture approaches, we have found that whether or not architecture emerges through continuous refactoring depends upon several contextual factors. Our study has identified 20 factors that have been categorized into four elements: project, team, practices, and organization. These empirically identified contextual factors are expected to help practitioners to make informed decisions about their architecture practices in agile software development. software architecture, software maintenance, software prototyping, evidence-based understanding, agile software development, continuous small refactoring, software architecture practices, contextual factors, Computer architecture, Software, Software architecture, Organizations, Data analysis, Encoding, software architecture, agile software development component, empirical study",towards an evidence based understanding of emergence of architecture through continuous refactoring in agile software development the proponents of agile software development approaches claim that software architecture emerges from continuous small refactoring hence there is not much value in spending upfront effort on architecture related issues based on a large scale empirical study involving 102 practitioners who had worked with agile and architecture approaches we have found that whether or not architecture emerges through continuous refactoring depends upon several contextual factors our study has identified 20 factors that have been categorized into four elements project team practices and organization these empirically identified contextual factors are expected to help practitioners to make informed decisions about their architecture practices in agile software development software architecture software maintenance software prototyping evidence based understanding agile software development continuous small refactoring software architecture practices contextual factors computer architecture software software architecture organizations data analysis encoding software architecture agile software development component empirical study,158,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
145,0,57,11,290,"inCode.Rules: An agile approach for defining and checking architectural constraints The size and complexity of software systems is constantly and abruptly increasing, as well as the size of the teams who develop them. Although software systems usually start with a clean design and an unitary architecture, preserving the design quality in the final product, especially its modularity and reusability, depends on the programmers' ability to understand, implement and maintain the initial architecture of the system; in other words, it depends on the ability to preserve a common vision about the high-level design i.e., to preserve the architectural integrity. This is an essential problem, and it has led to a number of approaches that help maintaining architectural integrity by allowing for the specification and checking of architectural rules (constraints) in code. Unfortunately, these approaches are rarely used in practice because of their excessive complexity, lack of flexibility and absence of integration with the actual development environment. In this paper we propose a new, agile approach to defining and checking architectural constraints. The proposed solution consists, on one hand, of the inCode.Rules language that offers a highly intuitive, yet flexible, means for defining architectural rules. On the other hand, inCode.Rules is far more than a language specification: in the paper we show how architectural rules can be automatically checked using the inCode.Rules interpreter; and how they can be easily edited using the full-fledged editor that we created. Both the interpreter and the editor are tightly integrated in the Eclipse IDE. Furthermore, inCode.Rules has grown beyond being just a prototype as it has been already successfully applied on large-scale systems of over 1 MLOC. Thus, inCode.Rules provides a more agile approach to architecture verification, as it brings the evolution of code and architecture closer than ever before. formal specification, formal verification,

146,0,31,10,153,"Towards an Agile Design of the Enterprise Architecture Management Function Enterprise architecture (EA) management provides an engineering approach for the continuous advancement of the enterprise as a whole. The high number of involved components and their dense web of interdependencies nevertheless form a major challenge for such approach and demand high initial investment into documentations, communications, and analysis. Aforementioned fact has in the past been an impediment for successful EA management in practice. In the field of software engineering recently lightweight and agile methods have become more and more important. These methods aim at quickly creating results, while staying flexible in respect to the design goals to attain. In this article we explore to which extent the de-facto standard for agile methods, namely Scrum, can be applied to EA management. Thereby, we derive challenges for an agile EA management approach and revisit current approaches regarding their agility. Finally, we outline how agile EA management can be implemented based on the method of Scrum. business data processing, software engineering, enterprise architecture management function, agile design, software engineering, Scrum method, Computer architecture, Software, Programming, Decision making, Terminology, Iterative methods, enterprise architecture, EA management, agile methods, scrum",towards an agile design of the enterprise architecture management function enterprise architecture ea management provides an engineering approach for the continuous advancement of the enterprise as a whole the high number of involved components and their dense web of interdependencies nevertheless form a major challenge for such approach and demand high initial investment into documentations communications and analysis aforementioned fact has in the past been an impediment for successful ea management in practice in the field of software engineering recently lightweight and agile methods have become more and more important these methods aim at quickly creating results while staying flexible in respect to the design goals to attain in this article we explore to which extent the de facto standard for agile methods namely scrum can be applied to ea management thereby we derive challenges for an agile ea management approach and revisit current approaches regarding their agility finally we outline how agile ea management can be implemented based on the method of scrum business data processing software engineering enterprise architecture management function agile design software engineering scrum method computer architecture software programming decision making terminology iterative methods enterprise architecture ea management agile methods scrum,195,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
147,0,52,8,153,"Project Management and Workflow Analysis of Agile Manufacturing Agile manufacturing (AM) is a typical concurrent and collaborative way between different enterprises and different departments in order to meet market requirement for time, cost and quality as soon as possible. From the point of view, AM is special project management. Agile manufacturing and project management (PM) have many same characteristics. The characteristics and relations of AM and PM are discussed firstly. The resources of the manufacturing enterprise alliances have characteristics such as autonomous, distributed, heterogeneous, dynamic, and so on. Therefore, the PM of AM is different from traditional PM. Secondly, a typical workflow of agile manufacturing is illustrated. Then the architecture of PM of agile manufacturing is proposed and analyzed, which includes some key technologies to support good project management. Combining the automation and standards of the workflow with the PM of high quality is a good solution to agile manufacturing. Finally, the technologies of information exchange and communication mechanism are introduced. agile manufacturing, project management, workflow management software, project management, workflow analysis, agile manufacturing, manufacturing enterprise alliances, information exchange, communication mechanism, workflow management system, Project management, Agile manufacturing, Manufacturing automation, Manufacturing processes, Optimal scheduling, Computer aided manufacturing, Educational institutions, Workflow management software, Isolation technology, Computer networks, Agile manufacturing, project management, workflow, communication mechanism",project management and workflow analysis of agile manufacturing agile manufacturing am is a typical concurrent and collaborative way between different enterprises and different departments in order to meet market requirement for time cost and quality as soon as possible from the point of view am is special project management agile manufacturing and project management pm have many same characteristics the characteristics and relations of am and pm are discussed firstly the resources of the manufacturing enterprise alliances have characteristics such as autonomous distributed heterogeneous dynamic and so on therefore the pm of am is different from traditional pm secondly a typical workflow of agile manufacturing is illustrated then the architecture of pm of agile manufacturing is proposed and analyzed which includes some key technologies to support good project management combining the automation and standards of the workflow with the pm of high quality is a good solution to agile manufacturing finally the technologies of information exchange and communication mechanism are introduced agile manufacturing project management workflow management software project management workflow analysis agile manufacturing manufacturing enterprise alliances information exchange communication mechanism workflow management system project management agile manufacturing manufacturing automation manufacturing processes optimal scheduling computer aided manufacturing educational institutions workflow management software isolation technology computer networks agile manufacturing project management workflow communication mechanism,213,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
148,0,33,7,149,"U-SCRUM: An Agile Methodology for Promoting Usability SCRUM poses key challenges for usability (Baxter et al., 2008). First, product goals are set without an adequate study of the userpsilas needs and context. The user stories selected may not be good enough from the usability perspective. Second, user stories of usability import may not be prioritized high enough. Third, given the fact that a product owner thinks in terms of the minimal marketable set of features in a just-in-time process, it is difficult for the development team to get a holistic view of the desired product or features. This experience report proposes U-SCRUM as a variant of the SCRUM methodology. Unlike typical SCRUM, where at best a team member is responsible for usability, U-SCRUM is based on our experience with having two product owners, one focused on usability and the other on the more conventional functions. Our preliminary result is that U-SCRUM yields improved usability than SCRUM. software engineering, agile methodology, product goals, user stories, usability perspective, usability import, just-in-time process, Usability, Business, Marketing and sales, Organizations, Software, Lead, Software architecture, usability, user experience, product owner, roles, two, dual, process",u scrum an agile methodology for promoting usability scrum poses key challenges for usability baxter et al 2008 first product goals are set without an adequate study of the userpsilas needs and context the user stories selected may not be good enough from the usability perspective second user stories of usability import may not be prioritized high enough third given the fact that a product owner thinks in terms of the minimal marketable set of features in a just in time process it is difficult for the development team to get a holistic view of the desired product or features this experience report proposes u scrum as a variant of the scrum methodology unlike typical scrum where at best a team member is responsible for usability u scrum is based on our experience with having two product owners one focused on usability and the other on the more conventional functions our preliminary result is that u scrum yields improved usability than scrum software engineering agile methodology product goals user stories usability perspective usability import just in time process usability business marketing and sales organizations software lead software architecture usability user experience product owner roles two dual process,197,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
149,0,48,8,122,"Agile product manufacturing by dynamically generating control instructions Grid Manufacturing (GM) is a new production paradigm, based upon the use of standardized and modular Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS). In GM all systems have a virtual counterpart that actsautonomously, this includes both complete manufacturing systems and the products. The control system required for this approach is based upon a distributed and hybrid architecture, using agent technology. An important aspect in the paradigm is the product manufacturing description. This paper introduces the concept of an architecture where the control of the manufacturing is abstracted from the product manufacturing blueprint. A product is delineated step by step by specific services in the grid. The proposed system increases flexibility twofold, first by enabling abstraction of product's parts and second by dynamically using manufacturing means. agile manufacturing, control systems, flexible manufacturing systems, grid computing, virtual reality, Agile product manufacturing, grid manufacturing, production paradigm, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, RMS, virtual counterpart, control system, hybrid architecture, agent technology, Hardware, Manufacturing processes, Agile manufacturing, Industries, Agile Manufacturing, Distributed Systems, Agent Technology, Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems, Multi Agent Systems",agile product manufacturing by dynamically generating control instructions grid manufacturing gm is a new production paradigm based upon the use of standardized and modular reconfigurable manufacturing systems rms in gm all systems have a virtual counterpart that actsautonomously this includes both complete manufacturing systems and the products the control system required for this approach is based upon a distributed and hybrid architecture using agent technology an important aspect in the paradigm is the product manufacturing description this paper introduces the concept of an architecture where the control of the manufacturing is abstracted from the product manufacturing blueprint a product is delineated step by step by specific services in the grid the proposed system increases flexibility twofold first by enabling abstraction of product s parts and second by dynamically using manufacturing means agile manufacturing control systems flexible manufacturing systems grid computing virtual reality agile product manufacturing grid manufacturing production paradigm reconfigurable manufacturing systems rms virtual counterpart control system hybrid architecture agent technology hardware manufacturing processes agile manufacturing industries agile manufacturing distributed systems agent technology reconfigurable manufacturing systems multi agent systems,179,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

152,0,40,9,124,"Realizing Business Agility Requirements through SOA and Cloud Computing In the past five years, the IT community has witnessed the adoption of two major trends that had significant ramifications on how software solutions are developed and deployed. The first trend is focused on the software development side and is manifested through the popular use and adoption of software services and service oriented architecture (SOA).

Both trends are here to stay and pose many challenges for both business and IT on how to leverage them to enhance the overall productivity, agility and efficiency of the overall organization.

154,0,46,14,163,"Research on e-Commerce Application Architecture Based on the Integration of Workflow and Agile Service In the current e-commerce applications, the existence of a large number of complex issues is mainly due to the complexity of e-commerce applications' own problem domain and the complication caused by building them on Web. In addition, constant changes in business environment have increased the difficulty of software development. Many styles such as heavy SOA style, the workflow-oriented architectural style, and original rest style are created to solve these problems. Unfortunately, the previous studies did not take into account all aspects, and made a number of assumptions excluding the realistic complexity and mutability to facilitate research. This paper attempts to find out the architectural constraints contained in the architectural styles by analyzing the styles mentioned above and to design a set of architectural constraints, which can induce desirable architectural properties for e-commerce applications - e-commerce application architectural style based on the integration of workflow and agile service.

155,0,62,11,149,"Functional study of FDD equalizer in the context of TDD reconfiguration The radio architecture of the UMTS is composed of two modes: the FDD mode (WB-CDMA) and the TDD mode (TD-CDMA). Both must be included in the future mobile terminal to provide all services promised by the 3G. A work of reconfiguration will take into account the specificity of these two modes and will improve their switch. This processing simplification of these two modes can be envisaged to facilitating their implementation and cohabitation in the same terminal. For the TDD mode, the receiver called ""Ts-structure"" (L.Ros et al., July 2001) has been chosen for his good performance and low complexity. For the FDD mode, up to now, the conventional receiver is the Rake. Sometimes, the channel profile will oblige to add an equalizer in order to improve the Rake performance. The objective of this paper is to present a FDD equalizer with architecture similar to the equalizer TDD ""Ts-structure"". 3G mobile communication, frequency division multiplexing, equalisers, time division multiplexing, broadband networks, code division multiple access, radio receivers, cellular radio, UMTS, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System, FDD equalizer, frequency division duplex, WB-CDMA, wideband code division multiple access, TDD, time division duplex, TD-CDMA, 3G mobile communication, Equalizers, RAKE receivers, Matched filters, 3G mobile communication, Interference, Research and development, Switches, Software radio, Fading, Multipath channels",functional study of fdd equalizer in the context of tdd reconfiguration the radio architecture of the umts is composed of two modes the fdd mode wb cdma and the tdd mode td cdma both must be included in the future mobile terminal to provide all services promised by the 3g a work of reconfiguration will take into account the specificity of these two modes and will improve their switch this processing simplification of these two modes can be envisaged to facilitating their implementation and cohabitation in the same terminal for the tdd mode the receiver called ts structure l ros et al july 2001 has been chosen for his good performance and low complexity for the fdd mode up to now the conventional receiver is the rake sometimes the channel profile will oblige to add an equalizer in order to improve the rake performance the objective of this paper is to present a fdd equalizer with architecture similar to the equalizer tdd ts structure 3g mobile communication frequency division multiplexing equalisers time division multiplexing broadband networks code division multiple access radio receivers cellular radio umts universal mobile telecommunication system fdd equalizer frequency division duplex wb cdma wideband code division multiple access tdd time division duplex td cdma 3g mobile communication equalizers rake receivers matched filters 3g mobile communication interference research and development switches software radio fading multipath channels,228,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

158,0,42,12,95,"Selecting UML models for test-driven development along the automation systems engineering process Test-driven development (TDD) - an established approach in business IT software development - enables test case generation based on models early in the development process. Applying TDD and models in automation systems engineering (ASE) can increase testing effectiveness and efficiency. A key question is which models are suitable for ASE application. UML models support software and systems engineering development in (a) systematically capturing requirements, (b) describing the static system architecture, and (c) specifying dynamic systems behavior. In this paper we discuss selection criteria for UML model selection in ASE and evaluate strengths and limitations of selected models. program testing, software engineering, Unified Modeling Language, UML model, test driven development, automation system engineering process, business IT software development approach, test case generation, Unified modeling language, Modeling, Automation, Testing, Business, Programming, Software, Automation Systems Development, UML, Test-Driven Development, Test Case Generation",selecting uml models for test driven development along the automation systems engineering process test driven development tdd an established approach in business it software development enables test case generation based on models early in the development process applying tdd and models in automation systems engineering ase can increase testing effectiveness and efficiency a key question is which models are suitable for ase application uml models support software and systems engineering development in a systematically capturing requirements b describing the static system architecture and c specifying dynamic systems behavior in this paper we discuss selection criteria for uml model selection in ase and evaluate strengths and limitations of selected models program testing software engineering unified modeling language uml model test driven development automation system engineering process business it software development approach test case generation unified modeling language modeling automation testing business programming software automation systems development uml test driven development test case generation,152,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

For web development popular agile architecture is MVC (Model-View-Controller). For transferring data between controller and view XML is very suitable. And to transform it into final form it's better to use XSLT. XSLT is not very popular among developers, because they think this is just yet another ``strange'' language, without any real advantage comparing to usual languages. But advantages are real - XSLT allows for very interesting results, not possible with other templating languages. It definitely worth studying and this is not hard.

162,0,25,8,115,"Tackling Offshore Communication Challenges with Agile Architecture-Centric Development Offshoring is not as popular as it seems. According to a recent German survey, only 1.5% of all outsourcing activities target offshore locations. This is a remarkably small figure taking into account the widely published purported benefits of offshoring. In this paper we demonstrate that communication problems are at the core of offshoring woes. This does not come as a surprise as they also play a major role in onshore projects. Based on our experience in tackling these challenges with our well established communication-centered agile design and development approach, we present case-study-reinforced advice for successful offshore projects. We show that a common view of the underlying architecture is of paramount importance for these projects. software engineering, offshore communication, agile architecture-centric development, German survey, offshoring, Cultural differences, Costs, Global communication, Software architecture, Outsourcing, Management training, Productivity, Software engineering, Informatics, Programming",tackling offshore communication challenges with agile architecture centric development offshoring is not as popular as it seems according to a recent german survey only 1 5 of all outsourcing activities target offshore locations this is a remarkably small figure taking into account the widely published purported benefits of offshoring in this paper we demonstrate that communication problems are at the core of offshoring woes this does not come as a surprise as they also play a major role in onshore projects based on our experience in tackling these challenges with our well established communication centered agile design and development approach we present case study reinforced advice for successful offshore projects we show that a common view of the underlying architecture is of paramount importance for these projects software engineering offshore communication agile architecture centric development german survey offshoring cultural differences costs global communication software architecture outsourcing management training productivity software engineering informatics programming,153,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Recent advances in the area of Software Defined Networking (SDN) launch the design of innovative SDN-based solutions for resource sharing in multi-tier networks of macrocell and small-sized base stations, a.k.a.

Assuming a multi-operator environment of Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) macrocells complemented by multi-tenant Time Division Duplex (TDD) pico cells, we present a SDN-based architecture that allows efficient resource sharing among the TDD and FDD systems in a dynamic way. A TDD frame re-configuration mechanism is also employed, to optimize the ratio of uplink and downlink slots in the TDD frame of picocells. System-level simulation results demonstrate that the combination of these two functional enhancements in the LTE-A HetNet, significantly reduces the application layer delay for both the FDD macrocell

164,0,66,9,163,"On the Influence of Test-Driven Development on Software Design Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile software development strategy that addresses both design and testing. This paper describes a controlled experiment that examines the effects of TDD on internal software design quality. The experiment was conducted with undergraduate students in a software engineering course. Students in three groups completed semester-long programming projects using either an iterative test-first (TDD), iterative test-last, or linear test-last approach. Results from this study indicate that TDD can be an effective software design approach improving both code-centric aspects such as object decomposition, test coverage, and external quality, and developer-centric aspects including productivity and confidence. In addition, iterative development approaches that include automated testing demonstrated benefits over a more traditional linear approach with manual tests. This study demonstrates the viability of teaching TDD with minimal effort in the context of a relatively traditional development approach. Potential dangers with TDD are identified regarding programmer motivation and discipline. Pedagogical implications and instructional techniques which may foster TDD adoption will also be referenced computer science education, educational courses, object-oriented programming, program testing, software architecture, software quality, teaching, test-driven development, agile software development, internal software design quality, undergraduate students, software engineering course, programming project, iterative test-first approach, iterative test-last approach, linear test-last approach, object decomposition, iterative development approach, programmer motivation, programmer discipline, Software testing, Software design, Automatic testing, Programming profession, Iterative methods, Productivity, Writing, Software engineering, Linear programming, System testing",on the influence of test driven development on software design test driven development tdd is an agile software development strategy that addresses both design and testing this paper describes a controlled experiment that examines the effects of tdd on internal software design quality the experiment was conducted with undergraduate students in a software engineering course students in three groups completed semester long programming projects using either an iterative test first tdd iterative test last or linear test last approach results from this study indicate that tdd can be an effective software design approach improving both code centric aspects such as object decomposition test coverage and external quality and developer centric aspects including productivity and confidence in addition iterative development approaches that include automated testing demonstrated benefits over a more traditional linear approach with manual tests this study demonstrates the viability of teaching tdd with minimal effort in the context of a relatively traditional development approach potential dangers with tdd are identified regarding programmer motivation and discipline pedagogical implications and instructional techniques which may foster tdd adoption will also be referenced computer science education educational courses object oriented programming program testing software architecture software quality teaching test driven development agile software development internal software design quality undergraduate students software engineering course programming project iterative test first approach iterative test last approach linear test last approach object decomposition iterative development approach programmer motivation programmer discipline software testing software design automatic testing programming profession iterative methods productivity writing software engineering linear programming system testing,251,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

167,0,33,7,141,"A tale of two projects [agile projects] The author had a unique opportunity to experience and analyze the adoption of agile practices on two projects at a major car rental company which, although sharing many similarities including staff, professed commitment to agile process, architecture, and programming environment, experienced two drastically different outcomes. The first became bogged down and eventually went to production late, over-budget, with fewer features then expected, and was only reluctantly embraced by its user community. The second was ready for its first production milestone after only 9 weeks, was enthusiastically embraced by its users, and went on to become an unqualified success and a model for other software development projects at this company.

168,0,53,5,212,"Quality Attribute Driven Agile Development Agile development methods are being recognized as popular and efficient approaches to the development of software systems that have features such as a short delivery period and unclear requirements. They emphasize customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less time. According to a recent survey, SCRUM is one of the most popular methods that are currently being used. Some backlogs, especially high priority backlogs that are functional requirements of customers, are developed repeatedly at each sprint period. Despite the known advantages of SCRUM, however, its backlogs focus only on functional features. Thus, it is difficult to effectively reflect the softwares quality attributes. As known, the failure of a software project is caused by the non-satisfaction not of functional features but of quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability. This paper introduces the ACRUM that is a quality attribute driven agile development method. The main characteristic of the proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of SCRUM to be compatible with the SCRUM process and to keep its agility intact. The effect of ACRUM was evaluated through an agile process evaluation checklist and applying it into a commercial project of Samsung Electronics. The results showed that ACRUM is more efficient than the legacy agile development process. customer satisfaction, project management, software management, software prototyping, software quality, software quality attribute driven agile development, software system development, customer satisfaction, high-priority backlog, customer requirement, software project failure, SCRUM process, ACRUM process, Samsung electronics, legacy agile development process, Computer architecture, Business, Software architecture, Software systems, Random access memory, Quality Attribute, Agile, SCRUM, QAW",quality attribute driven agile development agile development methods are being recognized as popular and efficient approaches to the development of software systems that have features such as a short delivery period and unclear requirements they emphasize customer satisfaction fast response to changes and release in less time according to a recent survey scrum is one of the most popular methods that are currently being used some backlogs especially high priority backlogs that are functional requirements of customers are developed repeatedly at each sprint period despite the known advantages of scrum however its backlogs focus only on functional features thus it is difficult to effectively reflect the softwares quality attributes as known the failure of a software project is caused by the non satisfaction not of functional features but of quality attributes such as performance usability and reliability this paper introduces the acrum that is a quality attribute driven agile development method the main characteristic of the proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of scrum to be compatible with the scrum process and to keep its agility intact the effect of acrum was evaluated through an agile process evaluation checklist and applying it into a commercial project of samsung electronics the results showed that acrum is more efficient than the legacy agile development process customer satisfaction project management software management software prototyping software quality software quality attribute driven agile development software system development customer satisfaction high priority backlog customer requirement software project failure scrum process acrum process samsung electronics legacy agile development process computer architecture business software architecture software systems random access memory quality attribute agile scrum qaw,272,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

170,0,42,8,129,"FASOAD: A Framework for Agile Service-Oriented Architectures Development The development of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) requires modeling a service development process that covers the entire lifecycle of such architectures and allows an iterative and incremental development. In addition, the change of either environment execution conditions, or requirements, during the development may require the evolution of the process. In this paper, we present a framework named FASOAD that addresses this issue. FASOAD implements the phases of an agile approach for SOA development as a component assembly model.

172,0,58,12,174,"Architecture for Decision Logic Unit in Agile Manufacturing Planning and Control Systems Manufacturing control systems typically include layers of logic and heuristics making them difficult to develop. Furthermore, in agile manufacturing planning and control (MPC) environment, the dynamics of decision-making interactions between agile MPC system components are poorly understood and can be undependable because of the absence of a master controller or optimizer. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a multi-layer architecture for a supervisory decision logic unit (DLU) of an agile MPC system. After presenting a dynamic model for the system, a decision logic unit for that system that links the operational level with the higher enterprise level strategy is described. The architecture of the DLU is composed of three layers where the first layer is responsible for dynamically managing the selection of the different MPC policies that suits the market strategy. The second layer describes an algorithm for optimal parameters settings for each of the MPC policies. Finally the third layer of the architecture is responsible for the automatic on-line control of manufacturing system to maintain required production, work-in- process and inventory levels. agile manufacturing, decision making, optimisation, planning, agile manufacturing planning, manufacturing control systems, heuristics making, decision-making interactions, supervisory decision logic unit, enterprise level strategy, automatic online control, manufacturing system, inventory levels, Logic, Agile manufacturing, Control systems, Manufacturing systems, Automatic control, Control theory, Intelligent manufacturing systems, Electrical equipment industry, Manufacturing industries, Systems engineering and theory, Agile Manufacturing, Architecture, Planning, Control",architecture for decision logic unit in agile manufacturing planning and control systems manufacturing control systems typically include layers of logic and heuristics making them difficult to develop furthermore in agile manufacturing planning and control mpc environment the dynamics of decision making interactions between agile mpc system components are poorly understood and can be undependable because of the absence of a master controller or optimizer this paper addresses these challenges by developing a multi layer architecture for a supervisory decision logic unit dlu of an agile mpc system after presenting a dynamic model for the system a decision logic unit for that system that links the operational level with the higher enterprise level strategy is described the architecture of the dlu is composed of three layers where the first layer is responsible for dynamically managing the selection of the different mpc policies that suits the market strategy the second layer describes an algorithm for optimal parameters settings for each of the mpc policies finally the third layer of the architecture is responsible for the automatic on line control of manufacturing system to maintain required production work in process and inventory levels agile manufacturing decision making optimisation planning agile manufacturing planning manufacturing control systems heuristics making decision making interactions supervisory decision logic unit enterprise level strategy automatic online control manufacturing system inventory levels logic agile manufacturing control systems manufacturing systems automatic control control theory intelligent manufacturing systems electrical equipment industry manufacturing industries systems engineering and theory agile manufacturing architecture planning control,249,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A class-AB common-gate transformer-based low-noise transconductor amplifier (LNTA) is used to provide high linearity and harmonic filtering. A resonant passive mixer is adopted in order to allow the current-mode operation and improve the harmonic rejection. A low-power divider with intrinsic 25% duty-cycle is introduced to drive the passive mixer. A second-order Rauch biquad with complex poles makes-up the IQ blocker tolerant baseband.

This experience report will highlight these R&D leadership roles, describe flat, hierarchical, and matrix R&D organization structures, and then illustrate the influence of these organizational structures on key leaderships behaviors for an agile environment. These behaviors include leading versus managing, flexing existing team boundaries, driving both team and project success, and balancing team versus individual needs. The report concludes that while some organizations structures are more supportive in an agile environment, the organization structure is less important than identifying leaders who demonstrate those key leadership behaviors. behavioural sciences, project management, research and development, software development management, strategic planning, team working, large-scale organization structure, leadership behavior, large agile organization, team member, self-organized empowered team, R&D leadership role, resource management, strategic vision, flat R&D organization structure, hierarchical R&D organization structure, matrix R&D organization structure, team success, project success, agile environment, agile software development, Large-scale systems, Research and development, Testing, Project management, Medical services, Europe, Service oriented architecture, Resource management, Information technology, Financial management, behaviors, large-scale, leadership, roles, teams",influence of large scale organization structures on leadership behaviors in a large agile organization more than three teams or 30 team members with self organized empowered teams r d leadership roles are still needed to support teams through topics including resource management and strategic vision this experience report will highlight these r d leadership roles describe flat hierarchical and matrix r d organization structures and then illustrate the influence of these organizational structures on key leaderships behaviors for an agile environment these behaviors include leading versus managing flexing existing team boundaries driving both team and project success and balancing team versus individual needs the report concludes that while some organizations structures are more supportive in an agile environment the organization structure is less important than identifying leaders who demonstrate those key leadership behaviors behavioural sciences project management research and development software development management strategic planning team working large scale organization structure leadership behavior large agile organization team member self organized empowered team r d leadership role resource management strategic vision flat r d organization structure hierarchical r d organization structure matrix r d organization structure team success project success agile environment agile software development large scale systems research and development testing project management medical services europe service oriented architecture resource management information technology financial management behaviors large scale leadership roles teams,221,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
175,0,69,22,195,"Product Line Engineering in Large-Scale Lean and Agile Software Product Development Environments - Towards a Hybrid Approach to Decentral Control and Managed Reuse Despite the fact that lean and agile software development has become mainstream recently, especially for larger-scale organizations building complex products, the methodology leaves many architectural questions unanswered. For instance, agile methods such as Extreme Programming propose late architectural decisions and frequent refactoring, while others suggest an ""architectural runway"" as infrastructure for a certain set of upcoming customer features. Software ""product lines"" consist of a set of software products that share a common, managed set of features. These product lines are developed from reusable core assets incorporating variations in order to derive customer-specific product variants. Hence, this research explores interoperability and complementarity of lean and agile approaches in combination with a software product line engineering approach. With this position paper, we discuss both, (i) complementing architectural issues in large scale lean and agile development and (ii) providing methodological guidance to make product line engineering more agile and efficient. In doing so, we come to the conclusion that this combination enables us to build the right products in time and budget.

In collaboration with Krause GmbH and Lamb Technicon UK Ltd two full size demonstrator machines have been commissioned to evaluate a component based control system and its associated design environment. The Krause machine consists of a transport system and a tappet assembly station, the Lamb Technicon machine consists of a single station from a transfer line machine for cylinder head machining. The framework for HMI system's described in this paper meets the requirements that automated manufacturing production machines face from the emerging agile manufacturing paradigm. Machines must be able to respond quickly to continuous change by many globally distributed engineering partners. This facilitates visibility of the system common model to all the globally distributed engineering partners involved in a given project. Within the C-B framework, HMI systems are composed from instances of reusable software templates that are targeted at specific user types. User targeted operator interfaces offer a common look and feel that improves usability. The machine's configuration is achieved by populating a series of HMI templates to produce a complete machine HMI system. A thin client architecture is used based on server/client Internet technologies that allow the machine HMI to be executed on any Internet enabled computer using a standard Web browser. It is possible to drive both the real machine and a simulated 3D virtual machine model via the HMI, enabling engineers to be trained on the operation of the HMI prior to the real machine being completed. user interfaces, agile manufacturing, production equipment, client-server systems, Internet, agile automated manufacturing system, diagnostic capability, reconfigurable user interface,

machines face from the emerging agile manufacturing paradigm machines must be able to respond quickly to continuous change by many globally distributed engineering partners this facilitates visibility of the system common model to all the globally distributed engineering partners involved in a given project within the c b framework hmi systems are composed from instances of reusable software templates that are targeted at specific user types user targeted operator interfaces offer a common look and feel that improves usability the machine s configuration is achieved by populating a series of hmi templates to produce a complete machine hmi system a thin client architecture is used based on server client internet technologies that allow the machine hmi to be executed on any internet enabled computer using a standard web browser it is possible to drive both the real machine and a simulated 3d virtual machine model via the hmi enabling engineers to be trained on the operation of

Whatever the reason may be, outsourcing, organizational structure, or external collaboration, these projects often suffer from the physical separation of developing across the city, across the country, or around the world. Such distances intensify challenges such as peer communications, shared understanding between teams, and systems integration.

181,0,10,15,193,"Are learning styles useful indicators to discover how students use Scrum for the first time? Teaching agile practices is in the cutting-edge of Software Engineering education since agile methodologies are widely used in the industry. An effective strategy to teach agile practices is the use of a capstone project, in which students develop requirements following an agile methodology. To improve students' learning experience, professors have to keep track and analyze the information generated by the students during the capstone project development. The problem here arises from the large amount of information generated in the learning process, which hinders professors to meet each student's learning profile. Particularly, to know the students skills and preferences are key aspects on a learner-centered approach of education in order to personalize the teaching. In this work, we aim to discover the relationships between students' performance along a Scrum-based capstone project and their learning style according to the Felder--Silverman model, towards a first step to build the profiles. To address this issue, we mined association rules from the interaction of 33 Software Engineering students with Virtual Scrum, a tool that supports the development of the capstone project in the course. In the present work we describe promising results in experiments with a case-study.

182,0,15,12,134,"Geometric conditions for Kuhn--Tucker sufficiency of global optimality in mathematical programming We present geometric criteria for a feasible point that satisfies the Kuhn--Tucker conditions to be a global minimizer of mathematical programming problems with or without bounds on the variables. The criteria apply to multi-extremal programming problems which may have several local minimizers that are not global. We establish such criteria in terms of underestimators of the Lagrangian of the problem. The underestimators are required to satisfy certain geometric property such as the convexity (or a generalized convexity) property. We show that the biconjugate of the Lagrangian can be chosen as a convex underestimator whenever the biconjugate coincides with the Lagrangian at a point. We also show how suitable underestimators can be constructed for the Lagrangian in the case where the problem has bounds on the variables. Examples are given to illustrate our results.

183,0,8,8,182,"Collaboration and co-ordination in mature eXtreme programming teams Mature eXtreme programming (XP) teams are highly collaborative and self-organising. In previous studies, we have observed that these teams rely on two apparently simple mechanisms of co-ordination and collaboration: story cards and the Wall. Story cards capture and embody the user stories which form the basis of implementation, while the Wall is a physical space used to organise and display the cards being implemented during the current development cycle (called an iteration). In this paper, we analyse the structure and use of story cards and the Wall in three mature XP teams, using a distributed cognition approach. The teams work in different commercial organisations developing different systems, yet we find significant similarities between their use of these two artefacts. Although simple, teams use the cards and the Wall in sophisticated ways to represent and communicate information that is vital to support their activities. We discuss the significance of the physical medium for the story cards and the Wall in an XP team and discuss the considerations that need to be taken into account for the design of technology to support the teams.

185,0,14,14,188,"Adopting key lessons from agile manufacturing to agile software product development---A comparative study Many industrial new product development (NPD) software projects apply nowadays agile methodologies. These methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) date back to 1990s, and the Agile Manifesto was declared in 2001. However, already before that the concept of agile manufacturing (AM) was discovered to describe a corporate ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements. There is surprising amount in common between these two fields. This raises a question of whether NPD software development companies could take even more overall advantage of those different agile approaches. This interdisciplinary paper explores the commonalities between the key concepts of AM and some of the most popular agile software methods, and consequently suggests potential new areas for software process improvement (SPI) in large-scale NPD organizations. An industrial case example illustrates how agility in embedded software product development can be enhanced by following typical NPD principles.

187,0,13,12,279,"Considering rigor and relevance when evaluating test driven development: A systematic review Context Test driven development (TDD) has been extensively researched and compared to traditional approaches (test last development, TLD). Existing literature reviews show varying results for TDD. Objective This study investigates how the conclusions of existing literature reviews change when taking two study quality dimension into account, namely rigor and relevance. Method In this study a systematic literature review has been conducted and the results of the identified primary studies have been analyzed with respect to rigor and relevance scores using the assessment rubric proposed by Ivarsson and Gorschek 2011. Rigor and relevance are rated on a scale, which is explained in this paper. Four categories of studies were defined based on high/low rigor and relevance. Results We found that studies in the four categories come to different conclusions. In particular, studies with a high rigor and relevance scores show clear results for improvement in external quality, which seem to come with a loss of productivity. At the same time high rigor and relevance studies only investigate a small set of variables. Other categories contain many studies showing no difference, hence biasing the results negatively for the overall set of primary studies. Given the classification differences to previous literature reviews could be highlighted. Conclusion Strong indications are obtained that external quality is positively influenced, which has to be further substantiated by industry experiments and longitudinal case studies. Future studies in the high rigor and relevance category would contribute largely by focusing on a wider set of outcome variables (e.g. internal code quality). We also conclude that considering rigor and relevance in TDD evaluation is important given the differences in results between categories and in comparison to previous reviews.

188,0,11,9,274,"Automated error analysis for the agilization of feature modeling Software Product Lines (SPL) and agile methods share the common goal of rapidly developing high-quality software. Although they follow different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between them by (i) applying agile techniques to SPL activities so SPL development becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity. Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis support in order to make SPL development more agile and to produce error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract solution that relies on Reiter's theory of diagnosis is proposed; and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL.

189,0,10,13,266,"The impact of the Abilene Paradox on double-loop learning in an agile team This paper presents a qualitative investigation of learning failures associated with the introduction of a new software development methodology by a project team. This paper illustrates that learning is more than the cognitive process of acquiring a new skill; learning also involves changes in behaviour and even beliefs. Extreme Programming (XP), like other software development methodologies, provides a set of values and guidelines as to how software should be developed. As these new values and guidelines involve behavioural changes, the study investigates the introduction of XP as a new learning experience. Researchers use the concepts of single and double-loop learning to illustrate how social actors learn to perform tasks effectively and to determine the best task to perform. The concept of triple-loop learning explains how this learning process can be ineffective, accordingly it is employed to examine why the introduction of XP was ineffective in the team studied. While XP should ideally foster double-loop learning, triple-loop learning can explain why this does not necessarily occur. Research illustrates how power factors influence learning among groups of individuals; this study focuses on one specific power factor -- the power inherent in the desire to conform. The Abilene Paradox describes how groups can make ineffective decisions that are contrary to that which group members personally desire or believe. Ineffective decision-making occurs due to the desire to conform among group members; this was shown as the cause of ineffective learning in the software team studied. This desire to conform originated in how the project team cohered as a group, which was, in turn, influenced by the social values embraced by XP.

However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as this label implies. To provide a better understanding of lean software development approaches and how they are applied in agile software development, we have examined 30 experience reports published in past agile software conferences in which experiences of applying lean approaches in agile software development were reported. The analysis identified six types of lean application. The results of our study show that lean can be applied in agile processes in different manners for different purposes. Lean concepts, principles and practices are most often used for continuous agile process improvement, with the most recent introduction being the kanban approach, introducing a continuous, flow-based substitute to time-boxed agile processes.

191,0,6,9,128,"Using a role scheme to derive software project metrics Roles' playing is common in our lives. We play different roles with our family, at work as well as in other environments. Role allocation in software development projects is also accepted though it may be implemented differently by different software development methods. In a previous work [Y. Dubinsky, O. Hazzan, Roles in agile software development teams, in: 5th International Conference on Extreme Programming and Agile Processes in Software Engineering, 2004, pp. 157--165] we have found that personal roles may raise teammates' personal accountability while maintaining the essence of the software development method. In this paper we present our role scheme, elaborate on its implementation and explain how it can be used to derive metrics. We illustrate our ideas by data gathered in student projects in the university. Role scheme, Project metrics, Project-based course",using a role scheme to derive software project metrics roles playing is common in our lives we play different roles with our family at work as well as in other environments role allocation in software development projects is also accepted though it may be implemented differently by different software development methods in a previous work y dubinsky o hazzan roles in agile software development teams in 5th international conference on extreme programming and agile processes in software engineering 2004 pp 157 165 we have found that personal roles may raise teammates personal accountability while maintaining the essence of the software development method in this paper we present our role scheme elaborate on its implementation and explain how it can be used to derive metrics we illustrate our ideas by data gathered in student projects in the university role scheme project metrics project based course,144,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
192,0,6,8,141,"Understanding post-adoptive agile usage: An exploratory cross-case analysis While past research has contributed to the understanding of how organizations adopt agile methodologies (AM), little is known about their post-adoptive usage in organizations. By integrating theories from systems development methodologies, diffusion of innovations, and agile methodology literature, this paper proposes a new model that identifies a set of critical factors pertinent to post-adoptive usage of agile practices. This model is used to inform analysis of post-adoptive usage of agile practices in two major organizations. The results indicate relative advantage, team attitude and technical competence, championing, and top management support (TMS) are the key factors determining the extent to which agile practices can be assimilated into an organization. Specifically, both findings and this model confirm that the deeper the assimilation of agile practices into the organization, the better understanding of how assimilation leads to specific improvements in its systems development outcomes.

193,0,14,13,193,"Using Scrum to guide the execution of software process improvement in small organizations For software process improvement -- SPI -- there are few small organizations using models that guide the management and deployment of their improvement initiatives. This is largely because a lot of these models do not consider the special characteristics of small businesses, nor the appropriate strategies for deploying an SPI initiative in this type of organization. It should also be noted that the models which direct improvement implementation for small settings do not present an explicit process with which to organize and guide the internal work of the employees involved in the implementation of the improvement opportunities. In this paper we propose a lightweight process, which takes into account appropriate strategies for this type of organization. Our proposal, known as a ``Lightweight process to incorporate improvements'', uses the philosophy of the Scrum agile method, aiming to give detailed guidelines for supporting the management and performance of the incorporation of improvement opportunities within processes and their putting into practice in small companies. We have applied the proposed process in two small companies by means of the case study research method, and from the initial results, we have observed that it is indeed suitable for small businesses.

194,0,9,13,204,"A system-level fault detection and diagnosis strategy for HVAC systems involving sensor faults This paper presents a strategy for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of HVAC systems involving sensor faults at the system level. Two schemes are involved in the system-level FDD strategy, i.e. system FDD scheme and sensor fault detection, diagnosis and estimation (FDD&E) scheme. In the system FDD scheme, one or more performance indices (PIs) are introduced to indicate the performance status (normal or faulty) of each system. Regression models are used as the benchmarks to validate the PIs computed from the actual measurements. The reliability of the system FDD is affected by the health of sensor measurements. A method based on principal component analysis (PCA) is used to detect and diagnose the sensor bias and to correct the sensor bias prior to the use of the system FDD scheme. Two interaction analyses are conducted. One is the impact of system faults on sensor FDD&E. The other is the impact of corrected sensor faults on the system FDD. It is found that the sensor FDD&E method can work well in identifying biased sensors and recovering biases even if system faults coexist, and the system FDD method is effective in diagnosing the system-level faults using processed measurements by the sensor FDD&E.

196,0,9,8,188,"Motivations and measurements in an agile case study With the recent emergence of agile software development technologies, the software community is awaiting sound, empirical investigation of the impacts of agile practices in a live setting. One means of conducting such research is through industrial case studies. There are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed at Sabre Airline SolutionsTM evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study. We identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial case studies: availability of data, tool support, cooperative personnel and project status. Recognizing and planning for these factors is essential to conducting industrial case studies.

197,0,9,11,284,"Analysis of multiservice cellular networks with asymmetrical traffic and handoff queue The next generation mobile communication system should be able to accommodate various services, including voice and Internet dial-up. As is well known, voice service has symmetrical, i.e. equal uplink and downlink bandwidth requirements, whereas Internet dial-up traffic usually has asymmetrical, i.e. unequal uplink and downlink bandwidth requirements. Frequency division duplex (FDD) usually allocates the same bandwidth to both uplink and downlink, whereas time division duplex (TDD) can change the number of time slots allocated to uplink and downlink to allocate different bandwidth to uplink and downlink. Thus, for scenarios with asymmetrical traffic, TDD is a better solution. To provide better quality of service during handoff, make-before-break soft handoff is preferable to break-before-make hard handoff. Furthermore, as forced termination of an ongoing call is less tolerable than blocking of a new call, handoff calls are usually given priority over new calls. We consider cellular multiservice TDD networks supporting both symmetrical and asymmetrical traffic with soft handoff and handoff queueing. First, we derive the mathematical model of the considered system with multi-dimensional birth--death process. Second, since the asymmetrical traffic may lead to the waste of uplink or downlink bandwidth, the effects of the traffic mix and the number of uplink slots on the system performance are studied. Third, the comparison of TDD and FDD with the presence of asymmetrical traffic is performed. Fourth, as the handoff region area increases, more calls will enter into or originate at that region. Thus, we study the effect of handoff region area on performance. Fifth, as a handoff call that cannot obtain the required channel upon arrival will be rejected if the handoff queue is full, the effect of handoff queue size on the performance is studied.

198,0,16,12,237,"The Role of the Product Owner in Scrum-comparison between Theory and Practices New methods have emerged in last* decades for managing projects and develop software. The agile ideology was generally defined with the agile manifesto in 2001 and is widely used for software project management. Scrum is the most common method within agile and has become one of the most popular tools in software development in Iceland. The objective of this research was to shed light on how Scrum is applied. The role of the product owner is studied; the knowledge and skills he is required to have, according to the Scrum method. This is compared to the perception of a number of actual project owners of their role. Information was gathered by semi structured interviews with a limited number of product owners that have had that role for at least 1 year. The results show that the majority of the participants in the survey are using different project management methods. They apply the methods that best fit their own operations. The understanding of the role and responsibility of the product owner is quite different between organizations but seldom in perfect conformance with the official Scrum method. Cases were reported where there are two product owners for the same product. One is then responsible for business aspect but the other is responsible for technical aspects of the product. Scrum has a strong position in software development with its defined roles, collaboration emphasis, understanding, visibility, effective process and fast development.

199,0,8,12,197,"Engineering-based processes and agile methodologies for software development: a comparative case study The emergence of various software development methodologies raises the need to evaluate and compare their efficiencies. One way of performing such a comparison is to have different teams apply different process models in the implementation of multiple versions of common specifications. This study defines a new cognitive activity classification scheme which has been used to record the effort expended by six student teams producing parallel implementations of the same software requirements specifications. Three of the teams used a process based on the Unified Process for Education (UPEDU), a teaching-oriented process derived from the Rational Unified Process. The other three teams used a process built around the principles of the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology. Important variations in effort at the cognitive activity level between teams shows that the classification could scarcely be used without categorization at a higher level. However, the relative importance of a category of activities aimed at defining ``active'' behaviour was shown to be almost constant for all teams involved, possibly showing a fundamental behaviour pattern. As secondary observations, aggregate variations by process model tend to be small and limited to a few activities, and coding-related activities dominate the effort distribution for all the teams.

200,0,12,10,301,"Understanding agile software development practices using shared mental models theory Context Agile software development is an alternative software development methodology that originated from practice to encourage collaboration between developers and users, to leverage rapid development cycles, and to respond to changes in a dynamic environment. Although agile practices are widely used in organizations, academics call for more theoretical research to understand the value of agile software development methodologies. Objective This study uses shared mental models theory as a lens to examine practices from agile software methodologies to understand how agile practices enable software development teams to work together to complete tasks and work together effectively as a team. Method A conceptual analysis of specific agile practices was conducted using the lens of shared mental models theory. Three agile practices from Xtreme Programming and Scrum are examined in detail, system metaphor, stand-up meeting, and on-site customer, using shared mental models theory. Results Examining agile practices using shared mental models theory elucidates how agile practices improve collaboration during the software development process. The results explain how agile practices contribute toward a shared understanding and enhanced collaboration within the software development team. Conclusions This conceptual analysis demonstrates the value of agile practices in developing shared mental models (i.e. shared understanding) among developers and customers in software development teams. Some agile practices are useful in developing a shared understanding about the tasks to be completed, while other agile practices create shared mental models about team processes and team interactions. To elicit the desired outcomes of agile software development methods, software development teams should consider whether or not agile practices are used in a manner that enhances the team's shared understanding. Using three specific agile practices as examples, this research demonstrates how theory, such as shared mental models theory, can enhance our understanding regarding how agile practices are useful in enhancing collaboration in the workplace.

201,0,8,9,188,"An agile method for teaching agile in business schools The aim of this paper is to describe, evaluate and discuss a new method for teaching agile project management and similar subjects in higher education. Agile is not only a subject domain in this work, the teaching method itself is based on Scrum, a popular agile methodology mostly used in software development projects. The method is supported by wikis, a natural platform for simulation of software development environments. The findings from the evaluation indicate that the method enables the creation of ``significant learning'', which prepares students for life-long learning and increases their employability. However, the knowledge gains, resulting from wiki interactions are found to be more quantitative than qualitative. The results also imply that despite the active promotion of agile values of communication and feedback, issues regarding the teamwork are still emerging. The engagement of the teacher in the learning and teaching process was discovered to be a motivational factor for the team cohesion. This paper could be of interest to anyone planning to teach agile in the higher education settings, but also to a wider academic community interested in applying agile methods in their own teaching practice.

203,0,7,6,68,"An adaptive software development process model The concept of agile process models has gained great popularity in software (SW) development community in past few years.

204,0,9,10,283,"Successful extreme programming: Fidelity to the methodology or good teamworking? Context Developing a theory of agile technology, in combination with empirical work, must include assessing its performance effects, and whether all or some of its key ingredients account for any performance advantage over traditional methods. Given the focus on teamwork, is the agile technology what really matters, or do general team factors, such as cohesion, primarily account for a team's success? Perhaps the more specific software engineering team factors, for example the agile development method's collective ownership and code management, are decisive. Objective To assess the contribution of agile methodology, agile-specific team methods, and general team factors in the performance of software teams. Method We studied 40 small-scale software development teams which used Extreme Programming (XP). We measured (1) the teams' adherence to XP methods, (2) their use of XP-specific team practices, and (3) standard team attributes, as well as the quality of the project's outcomes. We used Williams et al.'s (2004a) [33] Shodan measures of XP methods, and regression analysis. Results All three types of variables are associated with the project's performance. Teamworking is important but it is the XP-specific team factor (continuous integration, coding standards, and collective code ownership) that is significant. Only customer planning (release planning/planning game, customer access, short releases, and stand-up meeting) is positively related to performance. A negative relationship between foundations (automated unit tests, customer acceptance tests, test-first design, pair programming, and refactoring) is found and is moderated by craftsmanship (sustainable pace, simple design, and metaphor/system of names). Of the general team factors only cooperation is related to performance. Cooperation mediates the relationship between the XP-specific team factor and performance. Conclusion Client and team foci of the XP method are its critical active ingredients.

205,0,9,11,212,"Low threading dislocation Ge on Si by combining deposition and etching Blanket and selective Ge growth on Si is investigated using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition. To reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) at low thickness, Ge deposition with cyclic annealing followed by HCl etching is performed. In the case of blanket Ge deposition, a TDD of 1.3×106cm−2 is obtained, when the Ge layer is etched back from 4.5μm thickness to 1.8μm. The TDD is not increased relative to the situation before etching. The root mean square of roughness of the 1.8μm thick Ge is about 0.46nm, which is of the same level as before HCl etching. Further etching shows increased surface roughness caused by non-uniform strain distribution near the interface due to misfit dislocations and threading dislocations. The TDD also becomes higher because the etchfront of Ge reaches areas with high dislocation density near the interface. In the case of selective Ge growth, a slightly lower TDD is observed in smaller windows caused by a weak pattern size dependence on Ge thickness. A significant decrease of TDD of selectively grown Ge is also observed by increasing the Ge thickness. An about 10 times lower TDD at the same Ge thickness is demonstrated by applying a combination of deposition and etching processes during selective Ge growth.

206,0,9,8,213,"Multi-sprint planning and smooth replanning: An optimization model Most agile methods divide a project into sprints (iterations), and include a sprint planning phase that is critical to ensure the project success. Several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, which makes the planning problem difficult. In this paper we formalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that, given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, produces a multi-sprint optimal plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. To cope with the inherent flexibility and uncertainty of agile projects, our approach ensures that a baseline plan can be revised and re-optimized during project execution without disrupting it, which we call smooth replanning. The planning problem is converted into a generalized assignment problem, given a linear programming formulation, and solved using the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer. Our model is validated on both real and synthetic projects. In particular, a case study on two real projects confirms the effectiveness of our approach; as to efficiency, for medium-sized problems an exact solution is found in a few minutes, while for large problems a heuristic solution that is less than 1% far from the exact one is returned in a few seconds. Finally, some smooth replanning tests investigate the trade-off between plan quality and stability. Agile methods, Scrum, Optimization models, Software engineering, Linear programming",multi sprint planning and smooth replanning an optimization model most agile methods divide a project into sprints iterations and include a sprint planning phase that is critical to ensure the project success several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan which makes the planning problem difficult in this paper we formalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints produces a multi sprint optimal plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users to cope with the inherent flexibility and uncertainty of agile projects our approach ensures that a baseline plan can be revised and re optimized during project execution without disrupting it which we call smooth replanning the planning problem is converted into a generalized assignment problem given a linear programming formulation and solved using the ibm ilog cplex optimizer our model is validated on both real and synthetic projects in particular a case study on two real projects confirms the effectiveness of our approach as to efficiency for medium sized problems an exact solution is found in a few minutes while for large problems a heuristic solution that is less than 1 far from the exact one is returned in a few seconds finally some smooth replanning tests investigate the trade off between plan quality and stability agile methods scrum optimization models software engineering linear programming,235,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Criticism is sometimes leveled at the academic Software Engineering community on the basis that current educational practices are too document-centric. Both students and practitioners have suggested that one of the popular, lighter-weight, agile methods would be a better choice. This paper examines the educational goals for undergraduate Software Engineering education and considers how they might be met by the practices of eXtreme Programming. Our judgment is that education about some agile practices could be beneficial for small-scale development. However, as it stands now, eXtreme Programming as a package does not lend itself for use in educating about large-scale system development in tertiary education. eXtreme programming, Agile methodologies, Tertiary education, Software engineering education",extreme programming helpful or harmful in educating undergraduates criticism is sometimes leveled at the academic software engineering community on the basis that current educational practices are too document centric both students and practitioners have suggested that one of the popular lighter weight agile methods would be a better choice this paper examines the educational goals for undergraduate software engineering education and considers how they might be met by the practices of extreme programming our judgment is that education about some agile practices could be beneficial for small scale development however as it stands now extreme programming as a package does not lend itself for use in educating about large scale system development in tertiary education extreme programming agile methodologies tertiary education software engineering education,124,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

By addressing the important issue of dealing with continuously changing requirements we are faced with panoply of new problems and a genuine need to revisit some principles and classic models of software developments. When it comes to the management of software projects and a way in which we are looking at the software processes and underlying practices, it becomes apparent that in the management practices the issue of uncertainty needs to be quantified and fully addressed. Similarly, it becomes of interest to develop lightweight models of software quality and software processes that are easy to construct and modify as well are transparent to the developer and manager. Given these arguments, in this study we propose logic models based upon the mechanisms of multivalued and fuzzy logic. The realization of such models gives rise to so-called logic networks that are easy to construct, calibrate and interpret.

211,0,6,7,151,"Evaluating performances of pair designing in industry Pair programming has attracted an increasing interest from practitioners and researchers: there is initial empirical evidence that it has positive effects on quality and overall delivery time, as demonstrated by several controlled experiments. The practice does not only regard coding, since it can be applied to any other phase of the software process: analysis, design, and testing. Because of the asymmetry between design and coding, applying pair programming to the design phase might not produce the same benefits as those it produces in the development phase. In this paper, we report the findings of a controlled experiment on pair programming, applied to the design phase and performed in a software company. The results of the experiment suggest that pair programming slows down the task, yet improves quality. Furthermore we compare our results with those of a previous exploratory experiment involving students, and we demonstrate how the outcomes exhibit very similar trends.

212,0,13,15,327,"Performance on agile teams: Relating iteration objectives and critical decisions to project management success factors Context While project management success factors have long been established via the golden triangle, little is known about how project iteration objectives and critical decisions relate to these success factors. It seems logical that teams' iteration objectives would reflect project management success factors, but this may not always be the case. If not, how are teams' objectives for iterations differing from the golden triangle of project management success factors? Objective This study identifies iteration objectives and the critical decisions that relate to the golden triangle of project management success factors in agile software development teams working in two-week iterations. Method The author conducted semi-structured interviews with members across three different agile software development teams using a hybrid of XP and Scrum agile methodologies. Iteration Planning and Retrospective meetings were also observed. Interview data was transcribed, coded and reviewed by the researcher and two independently trained research assistants. Data analysis involved organizing the data to identify iteration objectives and critical decisions to identify whether they relate to project management success factors. Results Agile teams discussed four categories of iteration objectives: Functionality, Schedule, Quality and Team Satisfaction. Two of these objectives map directly to two aspects of the golden triangle: schedule and quality. The agile teams' critical decisions were also examined to understand the types of decisions the teams would have made differently to ensure success, which resulted in four categories of such decisions: Quality, Dividing Work, Iteration Amendments and Team Satisfaction. Conclusion This research has contributed to the software development and project management literature by examining iteration objectives on agile teams and how they relate to the golden triangle of project management success factors to see whether these teams incorporate the golden triangle factors in their objectives and whether they include additional objectives in their iterations. What's more, this research identified four critical decisions related to the golden triangle. These findings provide important insight to the continuing effort to better assess project management success, particularly for agile teams.

213,0,19,12,187,"Hardness control for improvement of dislocation reduction in HVPE-grown freestanding GaN substrates Nano-indentation measurements on freestanding GaN substrates clearly showed, for the first time, that the hardness of the GaN crystal can be controlled by changing the growth conditions for hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). The hardness of the GaN crystal is probably governed by heterogeneous nucleation of dislocations through a nitrogen vacancy-related mechanism. The observed changes in the nano-indentation hardness can be explained in terms of the dependence on growth condition of the concentration of nitrogen vacancies in the GaN crystal. This control of the crystal hardness has a significant effect on the dislocation-reducing process during the HVPE-growth of freestanding GaN substrates. According to the theory, the threading dislocation density (TDD) should decrease continuously with increasing growth thickness. However, as a result of the accumulation of growth-induced stress, the reduction of TDD for a freestanding GaN substrate with a less-hard crystal stopped at a certain critical thickness and became saturated at around the mid-106/cm2 range. This saturation behavior of TDDs can be overcome by making the GaN crystal harder by changing the HVPE conditions, giving freestanding GaN substrates with extremely low TDDs in the range 105/cm2. A1.

214,0,29,9,210,"Obstacles to decision making in Agile software development teams The obstacles facing decision making in Agile development are critical yet poorly understood. This research examines decisions made across four stages of the iteration cycle: Iteration Planning, Iteration Execution, Iteration Review and Iteration Retrospective. A mixed method approach was employed, whereby a focus group was initially conducted with 43 Agile developers and managers to determine decisions made at different points of the iteration cycle. Subsequently, six illustrative mini cases were purposefully conducted as examples of the six obstacles identified in these focus groups. This included interviews with 18 individuals in Agile projects from five different organizations: a global consulting organization, a multinational communications company, two multinational software development companies, and a large museum organization. This research contributes to Agile software development literature by analyzing decisions made during the iteration cycle and identifying six key obstacles to these decisions. Results indicate the six decision obstacles are unwillingness to commit to decisions; conflicting priorities; unstable resource availability; and lack of: implementation; ownership; empowerment. These six decision obstacles are mapped to descriptive decision making principles to demonstrate where the obstacles affect the decision process. The effects of these obstacles include a lack of longer-term, strategic focus for decisions, an ever-growing backlog of delayed work from previous iterations, and a lack of team engagement.

215,0,16,12,158,"Low surface roughness and threading dislocation density Ge growth on Si (001) Although several recent studies have successfully reduced the threading dislocation density (TDD) in Ge films grown on Si, high surface roughness is still problematic for useful nanoscale lithography and device fabrication. In this work, we achieved both low TDD and surface roughness by repeating a deposition--annealing cycle consisting of the following steps: low temperature deposition, high temperature and high rate deposition, high temperature hydrogen annealing. The root-mean-square roughness of the 3-cycle sample is in the range of 0.4--0.6nm for 10×10μm2 scan field atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. The TDD measured by plan-view TEM is 0.8--1×107cm−2 with a 1.44μm thickness sample. Furthermore, a 4-cycle sample reveals further improvement in surface planarity and pit density in the AFM images with a thickness of 2.38μm Ge.

217,0,6,7,198,"Structural analysis of a fractional matching problem Mixed Software Programming refers to a novel software development paradigm resulting from efforts to combine two different programming approaches: Solo Programming and Pair Programming. Solo Programming refers to the traditional practice of assigning a single developer to develop a software module and Pair Programming refers to a relatively new approach where two developers work simultaneously on developing a module. In Mixed Programming, given a set of modules to be developed, a chosen subset of modules may be developed using Solo Programming and the remaining modules using Pair Programming. Motivated by applications in Mixed Software Programming, we consider the following generalization of classical fractional 1-matching problem: Given an undirected simple graph G=(V;E), and a positive number F, find values for xe,e∈E, satisfying the following: 1.x∈0,12,1∀e∈E.2.∑e∈δ(i)xe≤1∀i∈V, where δ(i)=e∈E:e=(i,j),i∈V.3.Maximize 2∑e∈Exe−F|i∈V:∑e∈δ(i)xe=1|.

218,0,9,11,171,"A review of fault detection and diagnosis methodologies on air-handling units Faults occurring in improper routine operations and poor preventive maintenance of heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems (HVAC&R) equipment result in excessive energy consumption. An air-handling unit (AHU) is one of the most extensively operated equipment in large commercial buildings. This device is typically customized and lacks of quality system integration, which can result in hardware failures and controller errors. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of existing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods for an AHU therefore inspire new approaches with high performance in reality. For this goal, the background of AHU systems, general FDD framework and typical faults in AHUs, is described. Ten desirable characteristics used in a review of FDD in chemical process control are introduced to evaluate the methodologies and results.

220,0,13,11,178,"Development of an Agricultural Management Information System based on Open-source Solutions A common problem associated with ready-made software is that businesses are forced to alter some of their processes in order to fully utilize the product. On the other hand, custom-made applications are specifically designed to accommodate the needs of the client's activities, so the final product will be based on their input during the software development process, and will be fine-tuned to fit the way your business operates. With this approach, an information system designed towards the management of agricultural properties, the Agrifootprint system, was developed. The main goal of the Agrifootprint system was to develop and implement a Web-based Geographic Information System, based on Open-Source technology, with a custom-made, comprehensive and user-friendly geospatial system, in order to integrate and manage data from several small agriculture enterprises. The development process was based in Agile methodologies: SCRUM and Evolutionary Prototyping. This option for agile development process brought the establishment of a relationship of complicity between the customer and the development team due to more real understanding of the requirements raised and the system that will be produced from these.

221,0,0,8,142,"Teaching extreme programming to large groups of students We find the extreme programming methodology highly suitable for introducing undergraduate students to software engineering. To be able to apply this methodology at a reasonable teaching cost for large student groups, we have developed two courses that work in tandem: a team programming course taken by more than 100 students, and a coaching course taken by around 25 students. In this paper we describe our view of how extreme programming fits into the software engineering curriculum, our approach to teaching it, and our experiences, based on two years of running these courses. Particularly important aspects of our set up include team coaching (by older students), fixed working hours, and colocation during development. Our experiences so far are very positive, and we see that students get a good basic understanding of the important concepts in software engineering, rooted in their own practical experience. []",teaching extreme programming to large groups of students we find the extreme programming methodology highly suitable for introducing undergraduate students to software engineering to be able to apply this methodology at a reasonable teaching cost for large student groups we have developed two courses that work in tandem a team programming course taken by more than 100 students and a coaching course taken by around 25 students in this paper we describe our view of how extreme programming fits into the software engineering curriculum our approach to teaching it and our experiences based on two years of running these courses particularly important aspects of our set up include team coaching by older students fixed working hours and colocation during development our experiences so far are very positive and we see that students get a good basic understanding of the important concepts in software engineering rooted in their own practical experience,150,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

224,0,8,9,85,"Do programmer pairs make different mistakes than solo programmers? Objective: Comparison of program defects caused by programmer pairs and solo developers. Design: Analysis of programs developed during two counter balanced experiments. Setting: Programming lab at University. Experimental units: 42 programs developed by computer science students participating in an extreme programming lab course.

225,0,8,7,143,"A layer-based method for rapid software development A layer-based method for rapid software development is presented in this paper. It follows the guidelines suggested by Extreme Programming (XP) that require highly expressive programming languages (i.e., Java) and CASE tools. As in XP, this method addresses rapid software development for small- or medium-sized projects. Further, for effective guidance on the development, it directs the construction of system components by imposing an architecture-based concept of layered specification and construction of these components through its activities. Since the method follows the guidelines suggested by XP and supports effective guidance by a layered development of architectural components, team productivities can be greatly enhanced with less (but effective) overheads on specification work. The method uses UML and Petri nets as its modeling tool; for illustration, an example application is presented that specifies and directs the development of a software system with business-oriented Internet services.

226,0,9,6,159,"A structured experiment of test-driven development Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice in which unit test cases are incrementally written prior to code implementation. We ran a set of structured experiments with 24 professional pair programmers. One group developed a small Java program using TDD while the other (control group), used a waterfall-like approach. Experimental results, subject to external validity concerns, tend to indicate that TDD programmers produce higher quality code because they passed 18% more functional black-box test cases. However, the TDD programmers took 16% more time. Statistical analysis of the results showed that a moderate statistical correlation existed between time spent and the resulting quality. Lastly, the programmers in the control group often did not write the required automated test cases after completing their code. Hence it could be perceived that waterfall-like approaches do not encourage adequate testing. This intuitive observation supports the perception that TDD has the potential for increasing the level of unit testing in the software industry.

227,0,7,14,178,"Field implementation and evaluation of a decoupling-based fault detection and diagnostic method for chillers Most existing Fault Detection and Diagnostic (FDD) methods for chillers are primarily tested and evaluated in a controlled laboratory environment. The controlled laboratory environment is usually configured and installed to satisfy the requirements of the FDD methods and therefore contain rich data sets. However, some measurements required by the FDD methods may not be commonly available on the field chillers. Therefore, field demonstrations and commercialization of chiller FDD is a big challenge since many practical issues must be addressed. In this study, a decoupling-based FDD method which can deal with multiple simultaneous faults was fully implemented online and evaluated in the field test environment. A step by step process of implementing the evaluated FDD method for the real application is described to aid readers to apply and use the method. Several occurrences of multiple simultaneous faults were found on the test chiller. The field test results show that the decoupling-based FDD method has potential to be incorporated within commercial FDD products or embedded into the control system onboard the chiller to monitor the health of the chiller's operation. Chillers, Decoupling-based FDD, Decoupling features, Field test",field implementation and evaluation of a decoupling based fault detection and diagnostic method for chillers most existing fault detection and diagnostic fdd methods for chillers are primarily tested and evaluated in a controlled laboratory environment the controlled laboratory environment is usually configured and installed to satisfy the requirements of the fdd methods and therefore contain rich data sets however some measurements required by the fdd methods may not be commonly available on the field chillers therefore field demonstrations and commercialization of chiller fdd is a big challenge since many practical issues must be addressed in this study a decoupling based fdd method which can deal with multiple simultaneous faults was fully implemented online and evaluated in the field test environment a step by step process of implementing the evaluated fdd method for the real application is described to aid readers to apply and use the method several occurrences of multiple simultaneous faults were found on the test chiller the field test results show that the decoupling based fdd method has potential to be incorporated within commercial fdd products or embedded into the control system onboard the chiller to monitor the health of the chiller s operation chillers decoupling based fdd decoupling features field test,204,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
228,0,8,5,333,"Pair dynamics in team collaboration From a recent field survey with a group of professional pair programmers, it was revealed that the programmers perceive a partner's personality, cognitive style and communication skills as the top three factors that lead to prudent pair programming. Based on this finding, the factors personality and communication skills, along with gender were selected for an experiment to analyze if a partner's human, intrinsic values influence the pair programming experience, specifically in the levels of satisfaction, compatibility, communication, and confidence. A total of 128 students majoring in Management Information Systems, Information Systems, and Information Technology participated in the experiment. Of the 68 undergraduates, 40 were first-year students and 28 were juniors; the remaining 60 were Master's degree graduate students. The students were formed into a total of 64 pairs based on their personality, level of communication skills, and gender. A total of three visits were made. During the first two visits, a set of four programming problems was used in four programming sessions lasting 45min each; two were individual programming sessions and two were pair programming sessions. At the end of each visit, a questionnaire was administered and collected. The questionnaire results revealed that the various Myers--Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality combinations did not significantly influence the levels of communication, satisfaction, confidence, and compatibility. The pairs that exhibited a high level of communication between partners did not necessarily experience a high level of satisfaction or exhibit compatibility between partners, nor did they have a high level of confidence regarding the finished product. The communication skill level seemed to have an impact on communication only. Similar to many previous gender-focused literatures, the same gender pairs did exhibit significantly higher levels of communication, satisfaction and compatibility than the mixed gender pairs. Within the same gender pairs, the female--female pairs showed a much higher level than the male--male pairs in those categories. Contrariwise, the same gender pairs did not show a significantly higher confidence level than the mixed gender pairs about their finished product.

Two educational software programs created by the participating teachers were described in order to explain what they were trying to do using Etoys and how they accomplished their goals. The results of an anonymous survey evaluating the difficulty of and the attitude toward learning Etoys indicate that teachers enjoyed learning Etoys and would like to continue to use it in the future although they found it was slightly more difficult, compared to their self-evaluated computer skill.

230,0,3,10,198,"SCRUMIA---An educational game for teaching SCRUM in computing courses Due to the increasing use of agile methods, teaching SCRUM as an agile project management methodology has become more and more important. In order to teach students to be able to apply SCRUM in concrete situations, often educational (simulation) games are used. However, most of these games have been developed more for professional trainings than taking into consideration typical restrictions of university courses (such as, class duration and low financial resources for instructional materials). Therefore, we present a manual paper and pencil game to reinforce and teach the application of SCRUM in undergraduate computing programmes complementing theoretical lectures. The game has been developed following a systematic instructional design process and based on our teaching experience. It has been applied several times in two undergraduate project management courses. We evaluated motivation, user experience and the game's contribution to learning through case studies on Kirkpatrick's level one based on the perception of the students. First results indicate the potential of the game to contribute to the learning of SCRUM in an engaging way, keeping students immersed in the learning task. In this regard, the game offers a low-budget alternative to complement traditional instructional strategies for teaching SCRUM in the classroom. SCRUM, Teaching, Game",scrumia an educational game for teaching scrum in computing courses due to the increasing use of agile methods teaching scrum as an agile project management methodology has become more and more important in order to teach students to be able to apply scrum in concrete situations often educational simulation games are used however most of these games have been developed more for professional trainings than taking into consideration typical restrictions of university courses such as class duration and low financial resources for instructional materials therefore we present a manual paper and pencil game to reinforce and teach the application of scrum in undergraduate computing programmes complementing theoretical lectures the game has been developed following a systematic instructional design process and based on our teaching experience it has been applied several times in two undergraduate project management courses we evaluated motivation user experience and the game s contribution to learning through case studies on kirkpatrick s level one based on the perception of the students first results indicate the potential of the game to contribute to the learning of scrum in an engaging way keeping students immersed in the learning task in this regard the game offers a low budget alternative to complement traditional instructional strategies for teaching scrum in the classroom scrum teaching game,214,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

It derives the exact closed-form outage probability expressions in the FDD system with analog network coding (ANC) by use of probability theory. To provide more insights, an approximated version for the exact outage probability is also developed in the medium-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The simulation results show that the derived exact outage probabilities match the results of Monte Carlo simulations in all SNR regions, while the approximated outage probabilities also approach the simulation results when the channel condition is good. It is interesting that ANC in the FDD two-way channel is proved to outperform that of in the time-division duplex (TDD) channel by the computer simulation.

Objective In this paper, we present a study on how a large organization within Ericsson with 400 persons in 40 Scrum teams at three sites adopted the use of Communities of Practice (CoP) as part of their transformation from a traditional plan-driven organization to lean and agile. Methods We collected data by 52 semi-structured interviews on two sites, and longitudinal non-participant observation of the transformation during over 20 site visits over a period of two years. Results The organization had over 20 CoPs, gathering weekly, bi-weekly or on a need basis. CoPs had several purposes including knowledge sharing and learning, coordination, technical work, and organizational development. Examples of CoPs include Feature Coordination CoPs to coordinate between teams working on the same feature, a Coaching CoP to discuss agile implementation challenges and successes and to help lead the organizational continuous improvement, an end-to-end CoP to remove bottlenecks from the flow, and Developers CoPs to share good development practices. Success factors of well-functioning CoPs include having a good topic, passionate leader, proper agenda, decision making authority, open community, supporting tools, suitable rhythm, and cross-site participation when needed. Organizational support include creating a supportive atmosphere and providing a suitable infrastructure for CoPs. Conclusions In the case organization, CoPs were initially used to support the agile transformation, and as part of the distributed Scrum implementation. As the transformation progressed, the CoPs also took on the role of supporting continuous organizational improvements. CoPs became a central mechanism behind the success of the large-scale agile implementation in the case organization that helped mitigate some of the most pressing problems of the agile transformation.

233,0,12,15,179,"A teamwork model for understanding an agile team: A case study of a Scrum project Context Software development depends significantly on team performance, as does any process that involves human interaction. Objective Most current development methods argue that teams should self-manage. Our objective is thus to provide a better understanding of the nature of self-managing agile teams, and the teamwork challenges that arise when introducing such teams. Method We conducted extensive fieldwork for 9months in a software development company that introduced Scrum. We focused on the human sensemaking, on how mechanisms of teamwork were understood by the people involved. Results We describe a project through Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork model, focusing on the interrelations between essential teamwork components. Problems with team orientation, team leadership and coordination in addition to highly specialized skills and corresponding division of work were important barriers for achieving team effectiveness. Conclusion Transitioning from individual work to self-managing teams requires a reorientation not only by developers but also by management.

234,0,10,12,308,"Impact of test-driven development on productivity, code and tests: A controlled experiment Context Test-driven development is an approach to software development, where automated tests are written before production code in highly iterative cycles. Test-driven development attracts attention as well as followers in professional environment; however empirical evidence of its superiority regarding its effect on productivity, code and tests compared to test-last development is still fairly limited. Moreover, it is not clear if the supposed benefits come from writing tests before code or maybe from high iterativity/short development cycles. Objective This paper describes a family of controlled experiments comparing test-driven development to micro iterative test-last development with emphasis on productivity, code properties (external quality and complexity) and tests (code coverage and fault-finding capabilities). Method Subjects were randomly assigned to test-driven and test-last groups. Controlled experiments were conducted for two years, in an academic environment and in different developer contexts (pair programming and individual programming contexts). Number of successfully implemented stories, percentage of successful acceptance tests, McCabe's code complexity, code coverage and mutation score indicator were measured. Results Experimental results and their selective meta-analysis show no statistically significant differences between test-driven development and iterative test-last development regarding productivity (χ2(6)=4.799, p=1.0, r=.107, 95% CI (confidence interval): −.149 to .349), code complexity (χ2(6)=8.094, p=.46, r=.048, 95% CI: −.254 to .341), branch coverage (χ2(6)=13.996, p=.059, r=.182, 95% CI: −.081 to .421), percentage of acceptance tests passed (one experiment, Mann--Whitney U=125.0, p=.98, r=.066) and mutation score indicator (χ2(4)=3.807, p=.87, r=.128, 95% CI: −.162 to .398). Conclusion According to our findings, the benefits of test-driven development compared to iterative test-last development are small and thus in practice relatively unimportant, although effects are positive. There is an indication of test-driven development endorsing better branch coverage, but effect size is considered small.

235,0,7,9,183,"A model of job satisfaction for collaborative development processes Modern software development relies on collaborative work as a means for sharing knowledge, distributing tasks and responsibilities, reducing risk of failures, and increasing the overall quality of the software product. Such objectives are achieved with a continuous share of the programmers' daily working life that inevitably influences the programmers' job satisfaction. One of the major challenges in process management is to determine the causes of this satisfaction. Traditional research models job satisfaction with social aspects of collaborative work like communication, work sustainability, and work environment. This study reflects on existing models of job satisfaction in collaborative environments, creates one for modern software development processes, and validates it with a retrospective comparative survey run on a sample of 108 respondents. In addition, the work investigates the impact on job satisfaction and its model of the agile practice of Pair Programming that pushes job sharing to the extreme. With this intent, the questionnaire also collected feedback from pair programmers whose responses were used for a comparative analysis. The results demonstrate that Pair Programming has actually a strong positive effect on satisfaction, work sustainability, and communication.

236,0,9,15,127,"Adsorption of non-ionic pesticide S-Metolachlor on layered double hydroxides intercalated with dodecylsulfate and tetradecanedioate anions The objective of the present research was to investigate the adsorption of non-ionic pesticide S-Metolachlor on two different organohydrotalcites (OHTs): one intercalated with dodecylsulfate (HT-DDS) and the other one with tetradecanedioate (HT-TDD) anions, both of them obtained by the coprecipitation method. The adsorbents and the adsorption products were characterized by X-ray diffraction and FT-IR spectroscopy. The results indicated that the adsorption of S-Metolachlor on the organohydrotalcite HT-TDD was higher than that on HT-DDS, but desorption was lower. The amount of S-Metolachlor adsorbed increased with temperature, especially for HT-TDD. S-Metolachlor desorption from HT-DDS and HT-TDD was characterized using two experimental procedures, which indicated the higher reversibility of S-Metolachlor adsorption from HT-DDS compared to HT-TDD. The results suggest the possibility to use both organohydrotalcites uptaking S-Metolachlor from contaminated water.

237,0,12,10,269,"Effects of active vs. passive recovery on repeated rugby-specific exercises The aim of this study was to determine the effects of active vs. passive recovery on performance of a rugby-specific intermittent test in rugby union players. Seven male rugby players (20.6$\pm$0.5 yrs; 181.9$\pm$10.0cm; 94.5$\pm$12.8kg) performed in random order, over two separate sessions, a specific repeated-sprint rugby test, the Narbonne test (6×4 consecutive actions: 1, scrummaging; 2, agility sprinting; 3, tackling; 4, straight sprinting) with 30s of passive or active recovery (running at 50% of maximal aerobic speed). The Narbonne tests were completed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) a 30-min rugby match. During the Narbonne test, scrum forces, agility and sprint times, heart rate and rate of perceived exertion were measured. Scrum forces were lower in active (74.9$\pm$13.4kg) than in passive recovery (90.4$\pm$20.9kg), only during the post-test (p<0.05). Fatigue index (%) (p<0.05) and total sprint time (s) (p<0.01) were significantly greater in active than in passive recovery, both during the pre-test (11.5$\pm$5.7% vs. 6.7$\pm$4.5% and 18.1$\pm$1.3s vs. 16.9$\pm$0.9s) and the post-test (7.3$\pm$3.3% vs. 4.3$\pm$1.5% and 18.3$\pm$1.6s vs. 16.9$\pm$1.1s). Consequently, the results indicated that passive recovery enabled better performance during the Narbonne test. However, it is obviously impractical to suggest that players should stand still during and following repeated-sprint bouts: the players have to move to ensure they have taken an optimal position.

238,0,9,6,131,"Agent-based simulation of a financial market This paper introduces an agent-based artificial financial market in which heterogeneous agents trade one single asset through a realistic trading mechanism for price formation. Agents are initially endowed with a finite amount of cash and a given finite portfolio of assets. There is no money-creation process; the total available cash is conserved in time. In each period, agents make random buy and sell decisions that are constrained by available resources, subject to clustering, and dependent on the volatility of previous periods. The model proposed herein is able to reproduce the leptokurtic shape of the probability density of log price returns and the clustering of volatility. Implemented using extreme programming and object-oriented technology, the simulator is a flexible computational experimental facility that can find applications in both academic and industrial research projects.

239,0,10,15,132,"How do personality, team processes and task characteristics relate to job satisfaction and software quality? This article analyses the relationships between personality, team processes, task characteristics, product quality and satisfaction in software development teams. The data analysed here were gathered from a sample of 35 teams of students (105 participants). These teams applied an adaptation of an agile methodology, eXtreme Programming (XP), to develop a software product. We found that the teams with the highest job satisfaction are precisely the ones whose members score highest for the personality factors agreeableness and conscientiousness. The satisfaction levels are also higher when the members can decide how to develop and organize their work. On the other hand, the level of satisfaction and cohesion drops the more conflict there is between the team members. Finally, the teams exhibit a significant positive correlation between the personality factor extraversion and software product quality.

240,0,13,11,266,"A BIM-enabled information infrastructure for building energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics Although energy-efficient building technologies are emerging, a key challenge is how to effectively maintain building energy performance over the evolving lifecycle of the building. Field experience shows that energy savings of 5--30% are typically achievable simply by applying energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging task, not only because the task itself is difficult, but also because the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly, creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD is both time and labor consuming. Secondly, the FDD module typically has its own ad-hoc platform, and the integration of this platform with the existing Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is technically challenging due to the incompatible interoperability. Finally, the information exchange itself is complex due to the existence of multiple functioning modules to make FDD workflow happen. To perform an efficient and effective FDD with the BEMS in buildings, information is needed to flow among an as-built building static information module, a building energy performance simulation module, a building operational data acquisition module and a FDD module. In such a complex process, it is challenging to ensure the information integrity and consistence. In this paper, we propose a Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled information infrastructure for FDD, which streamlines the information exchange process and therefore has the potential to improve the efficiency of similar works in practice. The proposed information infrastructure was deployed and implemented in a real building for a FDD case study.

241,0,4,9,229,"Oxygen loss and thermal double donor formation in germanium Kinetics of interstitial oxygen loss and oxygen-related thermal double donor (TDD) generation upon heat treatments of Ge:O crystals at 350$ ^\circ$C have been studied. The TDD concentration (NTDD) was derived from Hall effect measurements in the temperature range 77--400K. The bistability of the first TDD species was taken into account. The interstitial oxygen concentration ([Oi]) in the crystals was determined from measurements of the intensity of the infrared absorption band at 855cm−1 at room temperature with the use of a recently obtained calibration coefficient CO=1.05×1017cm−2. From an analysis of the [Oi](t) and NTDD(t) kinetics a confirmation of recent suggestions about faster diffusivity of small oxygen clusters compared to the diffusivity of single interstitial oxygen atoms was obtained. Average numbers (N) of oxygen atoms lost per TDD species created, N=Δ[Oi]/NTDD, were calculated at different stages of the TDD generation. The obtained values of N are consistent with those expected in accordance with the recent models of the TDD structure. In particular, an average number of oxygen atoms per TDD species was about 5 at initial stages of the heat treatment when the first members (the TDD2 and TDD3 species) of the TDD family were dominant. N was found to be about 10 after extended anneals at 350$ ^\circ$C when the TDD6 and TDD7 species were dominant.

242,0,9,12,159,"Two controlled experiments concerning the comparison of pair programming to peer review This paper reports on two controlled experiments comparing pair programming with single developers who are assisted by an additional anonymous peer code review phase. The experiments were conducted in the summer semester 2002 and 2003 at the University of Karlsruhe with 38 computer science students. Instead of comparing pair programming to solo programming this study aims at finding a technique by which a single developer produces similar program quality as programmer pairs do but with moderate cost. The study has one major finding concerning the cost of the two development methods. Single developers are as costly as programmer pairs, if both programmer pairs and single developers with an additional review phase are forced to produce programs of similar level of correctness. In conclusion, programmer pairs and single developers become interchangeable in terms of development cost. As this paper reports on the results of small development tasks the comparison could not take into account long time benefits of either technique. Pair programming, Peer reviews, Empirical software engineering, Controlled experiment",two controlled experiments concerning the comparison of pair programming to peer review this paper reports on two controlled experiments comparing pair programming with single developers who are assisted by an additional anonymous peer code review phase the experiments were conducted in the summer semester 2002 and 2003 at the university of karlsruhe with 38 computer science students instead of comparing pair programming to solo programming this study aims at finding a technique by which a single developer produces similar program quality as programmer pairs do but with moderate cost the study has one major finding concerning the cost of the two development methods single developers are as costly as programmer pairs if both programmer pairs and single developers with an additional review phase are forced to produce programs of similar level of correctness in conclusion programmer pairs and single developers become interchangeable in terms of development cost as this paper reports on the results of small development tasks the comparison could not take into account long time benefits of either technique pair programming peer reviews empirical software engineering controlled experiment,180,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
243,0,6,8,167,"Is Scrum and XP suitable for CSE Development? This article discusses the question if Scrum and XP is well suited for development of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software. The reason for choosing Scrum and XP is based on two facts. Firstly, CSE developers are not used to formal processes for software development and Scrum and XP are informal in nature, hence easier to adopt. Secondly CSE projects are often once-off and aimed at producing scientific results rather than commercial software, so the overhead of a process or methodology needs to be kept at a minimum. Scrum and XP are focused on producing software, thus keeping everything else, i.e. the overhead to a minimum, a fact that benefits CSE development. In this article, the characteristics of Scrum and XP in particular and agile development in general are evaluated against the needs of CSE developers. The results show that almost all the key points in both methodologies are well suited for CSE development and that agile development in general is a good match with CSE.

244,0,4,9,279,"Cooperation, collaboration and pair-programming: Field studies on backup behavior Considering that pair programming has been extensively studied for more than a decade, it can seem quite surprising that there is such a lack of consensus on both its best use and its benefits. We argue that pair programming is not a replacement of usual developer interactions, but rather a formalization and enhancement of naturally occurring interactions. Consequently, we study and classify a broader range of developer interactions, evaluating them for type, purpose and patterns of occurrence, with the aim to identify situations in which pair programming is likely to be truly needed and thus most beneficial. We study the concrete pair programming practices in both academic and industrial settings. All interactions between teammates were recorded as backup behavior activities. In each of these two projects, developers were free to interact when needed. All team interactions were self-recorded by the teammates. The analysis of the interaction tokens shows two salient features: solo work is an important component of teamwork and team interactions have two main purposes, namely cooperation and collaboration. Cooperative backup behavior occurs when a developer provides help to a teammate. Collaborative backup behavior occurs when the teammates are sharing the same goal toward solving an issue. We found that collaborative backup behavior, which occurred much less often, is close to the formal definition of pair programming. This study suggests that mandatory pair programming may be less efficient in organizations where solo work could be done and when some interactions are for cooperative activities. Based on these results, we discussed the potential implications concerning the best use of pair programming in practice, a more effective evaluation of its use, its potential benefits and emerging directions of future research.

245,0,10,11,127,"Modeling and simulation of open source development using an agile practice The goal of this work is to study the effects of the adoption of agile practices on open source development. In particular, we started to evaluate the effects of TDD (Test Driven Development) since it is easer to apply in a distributed environment than most other agile practices. In order to reach this goal we used the simulation modeling approach. We developed a simulation model of open source software development process. The model was tuned using data from a real FLOSS project: Apache HTTP Server. To introduce the TDD practice in our FLOSS simulation model, we made some assumptions based on empirical results. The two FLOSS development models (nonTDD and TDD) were compared. The one incorporating the agile practice yields better results in terms of code quality. Software process simulation, Open source, Extreme programming, Test driven development",modeling and simulation of open source development using an agile practice the goal of this work is to study the effects of the adoption of agile practices on open source development in particular we started to evaluate the effects of tdd test driven development since it is easer to apply in a distributed environment than most other agile practices in order to reach this goal we used the simulation modeling approach we developed a simulation model of open source software development process the model was tuned using data from a real floss project apache http server to introduce the tdd practice in our floss simulation model we made some assumptions based on empirical results the two floss development models nontdd and tdd were compared the one incorporating the agile practice yields better results in terms of code quality software process simulation open source extreme programming test driven development,148,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
246,0,11,9,190,"Story Points Based Effort Estimation Model for Software Maintenance Software is developed with prior requirements and it is maintained continuously with rapid progresses in domain, technology, economy, and other fields. Software maintenance is vital and it requires more efforts and resources than development phase. There are fewer methods available for maintenance effort estimation. An iterative maintenance life cycle using extreme programming is a model for software maintenance based on agile methodology that uses RC stories as requirement artifacts. Agile methodology uses analogy and expert opinion based estimation techniques such as planning poker. But in software maintenance, historical data and experts may not be present or accurate. Therefore, a heuristic method is required for the calculation of maintenance efforts. In this paper, we propose a Software Maintenance Effort Estimation Model (SMEEM) for software maintenance estimation. The SMEEM technique uses story points to calculate the volume of maintenance and value adjustment factors that are affecting story points for effort estimation. The proposed model will be illustrated with various types of maintenance projects. The model generates accurate and effective results as compared to other software maintenance effort estimation models. This model is applicable only for agile and extreme programming based maintenance environment.

247,0,13,9,294,"Interpretative case studies on agile team productivity and management Context The management of software development productivity is a key issue in software organizations, where the major drivers are lower cost and shorter time-to-market. Agile methods, including Extreme Programming and Scrum, have evolved as ``light'' approaches that simplify the software development process, potentially leading to increased team productivity. However, little empirical research has examined which factors do have an impact on productivity and in what way, when using agile methods. Objective Our objective is to provide a better understanding of the factors and mediators that impact agile team productivity. Method We have conducted a multiple-case study for 6months in three large Brazilian companies that have been using agile methods for over 2years. We have focused on the main productivity factors perceived by team members through interviews, documentation from retrospectives, and non-participant observation. Results We developed a novel conceptual framework, using thematic analysis to understand the possible mechanisms behind such productivity factors. Agile team management was found to be the most influential factor in achieving agile team productivity. At the intra-team level, the main productivity factors were team design (structure and work allocation) and member turnover. At the inter-team level, the main productivity factors were how well teams could be effectively coordinated by proper interfaces and other dependencies and avoiding delays in providing promised software to dependent teams. Conclusion Teams should be aware of the influence and magnitude of turnover, which has been shown negative for agile team productivity. Team design choices remain an important factor impacting team productivity, even more pronounced on agile teams that rely on teamwork and people factors. The intra-team coordination processes must be adjusted to enable productive work by considering priorities and pace between teams. Finally, the revised conceptual framework for agile team productivity supports further tests through confirmatory studies.

248,0,11,10,100,"Integrated FDD system for valve stiction in a paperboard machine The performance of a modern industrial plant can be severely affected by the performance of its key devices, such as valves. In particular, valve stiction can cause poor performance in control loops and can consequently lower the efficiency of the plant and the quality of the product. This paper presents an integrated FDD system for valve stiction which employs various FDD methods in a parallel configuration.

249,0,12,7,154,"The effectiveness of pair programming: A meta-analysis Several experiments on the effects of pair versus solo programming have been reported in the literature. We present a meta-analysis of these studies. The analysis shows a small significant positive overall effect of pair programming on quality, a medium significant positive overall effect on duration, and a medium significant negative overall effect on effort. However, between-study variance is significant, and there are signs of publication bias among published studies on pair programming. A more detailed examination of the evidence suggests that pair programming is faster than solo programming when programming task complexity is low and yields code solutions of higher quality when task complexity is high. The higher quality for complex tasks comes at a price of considerably greater effort, while the reduced completion time for the simpler tasks comes at a price of noticeably lower quality. We conclude that greater attention should be given to moderating factors on the effects of pair programming.

250,0,12,16,285,"Systematic analyses and comparison of development performance and product quality of Incremental Process and Agile Process Context Although Agile software development models have been widely used as a base for the software project life-cycle since 1990s, the number of studies that follow a sound empirical method and quantitatively reveal the effect of using these models over Traditional models is scarce. Objective This article explains the empirical method of and the results from systematic analyses and comparison of development performance and product quality of Incremental Process and Agile Process adapted in two projects of a middle-size, telecommunication software development company. The Incremental Process is an adaption of the Waterfall Model whereas the newly introduced Agile Process is a combination of the Unified Software Development Process, Extreme Programming, and Scrum. Method The method followed to perform the analyses and comparison is benefited from the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods. It utilizes; GQM Approach to set measurement objectives, CMMI as the reference model to map the activities of the software development processes, and a pre-defined assessment approach to verify consistency of process executions and evaluate measure characteristics prior to quantitative analysis. Results The results of the comparison showed that the Agile Process had performed better than the Incremental Process in terms of productivity (79%), defect density (57%), defect resolution effort ratio (26%), Test Execution V&V Effectiveness (21%), and effort prediction capability (4%). These results indicate that development performance and product quality achieved by following the Agile Process was superior to those achieved by following the Incremental Process in the projects compared. Conclusion The acts of measurement, analysis, and comparison enabled comprehensive review of the two development processes, and resulted in understanding their strengths and weaknesses. The comparison results constituted objective evidence for organization-wide deployment of the Agile Process in the company.

251,0,6,5,214,"When agile meets the enterprise Context While renowned agile methods like XP and Scrum were initially intended for projects with small teams, traditional enterprise environments, i.e. environments where plan-driven development is prevalent, have also become attracted by the promises of a faster time to market through agility. Agile software development methods emphasize lightweight software development. Projects within enterprise environments, however, are typically confronted with a large and complex IT landscape, where mission-critical information is at play whose criticality requires prudence regarding design and development. In many an organization, both approaches are used simultaneously. Objective Find out which challenges the co-existence of agile methods and plan-driven development brings, and how organizations deal with those challenges. Method We present a grounded theory of the challenges of using agile methods in traditional enterprise environments, based on a Grounded Theory research involving 21 agile practitioners from two large enterprise organizations in the Netherlands. Results We organized the challenges under two factors: Increased landscape complexity and Lack of business involvement. For both factors, we identify successful mitigation strategies. These mitigation strategies concern the communication between the agile and traditional part of the organization, and the timing of that communication. Conclusion Agile practices can coexist with plan-driven development. One should, however, keep in mind the context and take actions to mitigate the challenges incurred. Agile development, Enterprise environment, Grounded theory",when agile meets the enterprise context while renowned agile methods like xp and scrum were initially intended for projects with small teams traditional enterprise environments i e environments where plan driven development is prevalent have also become attracted by the promises of a faster time to market through agility agile software development methods emphasize lightweight software development projects within enterprise environments however are typically confronted with a large and complex it landscape where mission critical information is at play whose criticality requires prudence regarding design and development in many an organization both approaches are used simultaneously objective find out which challenges the co existence of agile methods and plan driven development brings and how organizations deal with those challenges method we present a grounded theory of the challenges of using agile methods in traditional enterprise environments based on a grounded theory research involving 21 agile practitioners from two large enterprise organizations in the netherlands results we organized the challenges under two factors increased landscape complexity and lack of business involvement for both factors we identify successful mitigation strategies these mitigation strategies concern the communication between the agile and traditional part of the organization and the timing of that communication conclusion agile practices can coexist with plan driven development one should however keep in mind the context and take actions to mitigate the challenges incurred agile development enterprise environment grounded theory,230,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

A department at Ericsson AB introduced a test automation tool for component-level testing in two projects together with the concept test-driven development (TDD), a practice where the test code is written before the product code. The implemented approach differs from how TDD is used in Extreme Programming (XP) in that the tests are written for components exchanging XMLs instead of writing tests for every method in every class. This paper describes the implemented test automation tool, how test-driven development was implemented with the tool, and experiences from the implementation. Preliminary results indicate that the concept decreases the development lead-time significantly.

A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations.

254,0,17,7,84,"Model based testing in incremental system development The spiraling nature of evolutionary software development processes produces executable parts of the system at the end of each loop.

255,0,8,7,236,"Can agile methods enhance mechatronics design education? This paper presents a study of the integration of agile methods into mechatronics design education, as performed at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The chosen method, Scrum, and the context of the studied capstone course are presented. With the integration of Scrum into the capstone projects, an educational favorable alternative is identified, to previously used design methodologies such as more traditional stage-gate methods as the Waterfall or method or the V-model. This is due to the emphasis on early prototyping, quick feedback and incremental development. It still might not be the favorable method for use in large scale industrial development projects where formal procedures might still be preferred, but the pedagogical advantages in mechatronics education are valuable. Incremental development and rapid prototyping for example gives many opportunities for students to reflect and improve. The Scrum focus on self-organizing teams also provides a platform to practice project organization, by empowering students to take responsibility for the product development process. Among the results of this study, it is shown that it is possible and favorable to integrate Scrum in a mechatronics capstone course and that this can enhance student preparation for a future career as mechatronics designers or product developers. It is also shown that this prepares the students with a larger flexibility to handle the increased complexity in mechatronics product development and thereby enabling the project teams to deliver results faster, more reliable and with higher quality.

256,0,6,8,264,"Pair programming productivity: Novice--novice vs. expert--expert Agile Software Development methodologies have grown in popularity both among academic researchers and industrial practitioners. Among the various methodologies or practices proposed, pair programming, which is concerned with two programmers collaborating on design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest. Even though some success stories have been reported with the use of pair-programming in real software development environment, many people remain rather skeptical of the claims on pair-programming productivity. Previous studies in pair programming have only addressed the basic understanding of the productivity of pairs and they have not addressed the variation in productivity between pairs of varying skills and experience, such as between novice--novice and expert--expert. Statistical productivity measurements reported by different researchers also seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. Until now, the literature has not addressed how those results and experiments were related to each other. In this paper, we propose a controlled experiment called repeat-programming which can facilitate the understanding of relationships between human experience and programming productivity. Repeat-programming can be performed when controversial issues in non-traditional programming methodologies and development productivity need to be investigated into. To illustrate how the proposed empirical experiment can put arguable, divisive problems into perspective, we have examined the productivity in pair programming as a case study. With repeat-programming, we are able to (i) better understand why results of previous pair programming control experiments reached different conclusions as to the productivity of pair programming and (ii) most importantly, present a case in which novice--novice pairs against novice solos are much more productive than expert--expert pairs against expert solos.

257,0,8,12,162,"Challenges of shared decision-making: A multiple case study of agile software development Context Agile software development changes the nature of collaboration, coordination, and communication in software projects. Objective Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared decision-making in agile software development teams. Method We designed a multiple case study consisting of four projects in two software product companies that recently adopted Scrum. We collected data in semi-structured interviews, through participant observations, and from process artifacts. Results We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans with iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing development and maintenance tasks in teams. Conclusion Agile software development requires alignment of decisions on the strategic, tactical, and operational levels in order to overcome these challenges.

Our goal was to understand how this globally-distributed team created a successful project in a new problem domain using a methodology that is dependent on informal, face-to-face communication. We collected quantitative and qualitative data and used grounded theory to identify four key factors for communication in globally-distributed XP teams working within a new problem domain. Our study suggests that, if these critical enabling factors are addressed, methodologies dependent on informal communication can be used on global software development projects.

Thirteen software development teams with about 100 students took part in the experiments. The groups were divided into two sets with different working conditions. In one set, the group members worked on their projects in pairs. Even though the paired teams could only use half of the workstations the teams of individual workers could use, the paired teams produced nearly as much code as the teams of individual workers at the same time. In addition, the code produced by the paired teams was easier to read and to understand. This facilitates finding errors and maintenance.

262,0,7,9,199,"Pair programming and the mysterious role of the navigator Computer programming is generally understood to be highly challenging and since its inception a wide range of approaches, tools and methodologies have been developed to assist in managing its complexity. Relatively recently the potential benefits of collaborative software development have been formalised in the practice of pair programming. Here we attempt to `unpick' the pair programming process through the analysis of verbalisations from a number of commercial studies. We focus particularly on the roles of the two programmers and what their key characteristics and behaviours might be. In particular, we dispute two existing claims: (i) that the programmer who is not currently typing in code (``the navigator'') is constantly reviewing what is typed and highlighting any errors (i.e. acting as a reviewer) and (ii) that the navigator focuses on a different level of abstraction as a way of ensuring coverage at all necessary levels (i.e. acting as a foreman). We provide an alternative model for these roles (``the tag team'') in which the driver and navigator play much more equal roles. We also suggest that a key factor in the success of pair programming may be the associated increase in talk at an intermediate level of abstraction.

263,0,15,11,233,"Designing multi-agent unit tests using systematic test design patterns-(extended version) Software agents are the basic building blocks in many software systems especially those based on artificial intelligence methods, e.g., reinforcement learning based multi-agent systems (MASs). However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations.

264,0,8,10,235,"Combined ultrasonic vibration and chemical mechanical polishing of copper substrates This paper introduces an ultrasonic, vibration-assisted, chemical mechanical polishing (UV-CMP) method and an ultrasonic, vibration-assisted, traditional diamond disk (UV-TDD) dressing method. A copper substrate is polished by traditional CMP and UV-CMP. UV-CMP combines the functions of traditional CMP and ultrasonic machining (USM) with small-amplitude, high-frequency tool vibration to improve the fabrication process and machining efficiency. The removal rate of the copper substrate, torque force, and polished surface morphology of CMP and UV-CMP are compared. The polishing pad is also dressed by traditional diamond disk (TDD) and UV-TDD. The pad cut rate, torque force, and pad surface profiles of TDD and UV-TDD are also investigated in experiments. Experimental results reveal that UV-TDD can produce twice the pad cut rate and reduce torque force compared to TDD. Consequently, a dressing time reduction by half is expected, and hence, the diamond life is extended. It is found that the removal rate of the copper substrate polished by UV-CMP is increased by approximately 50--90% relative to that of traditional CMP because in UV-CMP, a passive layer on the copper surface, formed by the chemical action of the slurry, will be removed not only by the mechanical action of CMP but also by ultrasonic action. In addition, the surface roughness improves and the torque force reduces dramatically. This result suggests that the combination processes of CMP/USM and TDD/USM are feasible methods for improving polishing and dressing efficiency.

265,0,15,16,206,"An empirical study of system design instability metric and design evolution in an agile software process Software project tracking and project plan adjustment are two important software engineering activities. The class growth shows the design evolution of the software. The System Design Instability (SDI) metric indicates the progress of an object-oriented (OO) project once the project is set in motion. The SDI metric provides information on project evolution to project managers for possible adjustment to the project plan. The objectives of this paper are to test if the System Design Instability metric can be used to estimate and re-plan software projects in an XP-like agile process and study system design evolution in the Agile software process. We present an empirical study of the class growth and the SDI metric in two OO systems, developed using an agile process similar to Extreme Programming (XP). We analyzed the system evolutionary data collected on a daily basis from the two systems. We concluded that: the systems' class growth follows observable trends, the SDI metric can indicate project progress with certain trends, and the SDI metric is correlated with XP activities. In both of the analyzed systems, we observed two consistent jumps in the SDI metric values in early and late development phases. Part of the results agrees with a previous empirical study in another environment.

266,0,8,6,201,"Quantitative release planning in extreme programming Context Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the most popular agile software development methodologies. XP is defined as a consistent set of values and practices designed to work well together, but lacks practices for project management and especially for supporting the customer role. The customer representative is constantly under pressure and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan. Objective To assist release planning in XP by structuring the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable release plan. Method We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation. Results Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly. An example provides insight into uncertainties affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be applied in practice. Conclusion An optimization model can be used in practice to enable the customer representative to take more informed decisions faster. This can help adopting XP in projects where plan-driven approaches have traditionally been used. Extreme programming, Project management, Customer role, Integer programming",quantitative release planning in extreme programming context extreme programming xp is one of the most popular agile software development methodologies xp is defined as a consistent set of values and practices designed to work well together but lacks practices for project management and especially for supporting the customer role the customer representative is constantly under pressure and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan objective to assist release planning in xp by structuring the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable release plan method we develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size business value possible precedence relations themes and uncertainty in velocity prediction the running time feasibility is established through computational tests in addition we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation results computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly an example provides insight into uncertainties affecting velocity and indicates that the model can be applied in practice conclusion an optimization model can be used in practice to enable the customer representative to take more informed decisions faster this can help adopting xp in projects where plan driven approaches have traditionally been used extreme programming project management customer role integer programming,217,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
267,0,12,6,140,"Empirical evaluation of distributed pair programming Pair programming, in which two individuals share a single computer to collaboratively develop software, has been shown to have many benefits in industry and in education. One drawback of pair programming is its collocation requirement, which limits its use to situations where the partners can physically meet. A tool that supported distributed pair programming, in which the partners could pair from separate locations, would remove this impediment. This paper discusses the development and empirical evaluation of such a tool. A significant feature of this tool is the presence of a second cursor that supports gesturing. Students who used the tool in their introductory programming course performed as well as collocated students on their programming assignments and final exam. These students also spent less time working by themselves. They also felt that the gesturing feature was useful and used it regularly.

Both are wideband CDMA systems. CDMA systems are Multiple Access Interference (MAI) limited. Conventional detectors like the RAKE receiver do not decrease the MAI, this leads to a limited Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. For further improvement of system capacity Multiuser Detectors (MUD) should be applied. In this paper a non-linear approach employing Radial Basis Functions (RBF) is shown.

269,0,6,17,177,"A preliminary study on the impact of a pair design phase on pair programming and solo programming The drawback of pair programming is the nearly doubled personnel cost. The extra cost of pair programming originates from the strict rule of extreme programming where every line of code should be developed by a pair of developers. Is this rule not a waste of resources? Is it not possible to gain a large portion of the benefits of pair programming by only a small fraction of the meeting time of a pair programming session? We conducted a preliminary study to answer this question by splitting the pair programming process into a pair design and a pair implementation phase. The pair implementation phase is compared to a solo implementation phase, which in turn was preceeded by a pair design phase, as well. The study is preliminary as its major goal was to identify an appropriate sample size for subsequent experiments. The data from this study suggest that there is no difference in terms of development cost between a pair and a solo implementation phase if the cost for developing programs of similar level of correctness is concerned. Pair programming, Preliminary study, Post-development test-cases",a preliminary study on the impact of a pair design phase on pair programming and solo programming the drawback of pair programming is the nearly doubled personnel cost the extra cost of pair programming originates from the strict rule of extreme programming where every line of code should be developed by a pair of developers is this rule not a waste of resources is it not possible to gain a large portion of the benefits of pair programming by only a small fraction of the meeting time of a pair programming session we conducted a preliminary study to answer this question by splitting the pair programming process into a pair design and a pair implementation phase the pair implementation phase is compared to a solo implementation phase which in turn was preceeded by a pair design phase as well the study is preliminary as its major goal was to identify an appropriate sample size for subsequent experiments the data from this study suggest that there is no difference in terms of development cost between a pair and a solo implementation phase if the cost for developing programs of similar level of correctness is concerned pair programming preliminary study post development test cases,202,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

272,0,10,10,108,"An empirical study of relationships among extreme programming engineering activities Extreme programming (XP) is an agile software process that promotes early and quick production of working code. In this paper, we investigated the relationship among three XP engineering activities: new design, refactoring, and error fix. We found that the more the new design performed to the system the less refactoring and error fix were performed. However, the refactoring and error fix efforts did not seem to be related.

273,0,15,7,180,"Coordination in co-located agile software development projects Agile software development provides a way to organise the complex task of multi-participant software development while accommodating constant project change. Agile software development is well accepted in the practitioner community but there is little understanding of how such projects achieve effective coordination, which is known to be critical in successful software projects. A theoretical model of coordination in the agile software development context is presented based on empirical data from three cases of co-located agile software development. Many practices in these projects act as coordination mechanisms, which together form a coordination strategy. Coordination strategy in this context has three components: synchronisation, structure, and boundary spanning. Coordination effectiveness has two components: implicit and explicit. The theoretical model of coordination in agile software development projects proposes that an agile coordination strategy increases coordination effectiveness. This model has application for practitioners who want to select appropriate practices from agile methods to ensure they achieve coordination coverage in their project. For the field of information systems development, this theory contributes to knowledge of coordination and coordination effectiveness in the context of agile software development.

275,0,11,11,253,"Exploring the underlying aspects of pair programming: The impact of personality With the recent advent of agile software process methods, a number of seldom used and unorthodox practices have come to the forefront in the field of computer programming. One such practice is that of pair programming, which is characterized by two programmers sharing the same computer for collaborative programming purposes. The very nature of pair programming implies a psychological and social interaction between the participating programmers and thus brings into play a unique element that we do not see with the conventional individual programming model. This paper focuses on the effects that one of these psychosocial factors, a programmer's personality type, may have on the pair programming environment. In this study, a group of university students, 68 undergraduate students and 60 master's degree graduate students, each of whom had been personality type profiled using the Myers--Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model, was split into three sub-groups. One group consisted of subjects who were alike in MBTI type. Another group consisted of subjects who were opposite to each other in MBTI type, and the last group was comprised of subjects who were diverse -- partially alike and partially opposite -- in MBTI type. Through two pair programming sessions, the pairs in each group were assessed for their output, in code productivity. The result showed that the sub-group of subjects who were diverse in MBTI type exhibited higher productivity than both alike and opposite groups. In a comparison between alike and opposite groups, the productivity of the opposite group was greater than that of the alike group. Pair programming, Team programming, Collaborative programming, Myers--Briggs Type Indicator, Personality",exploring the underlying aspects of pair programming the impact of personality with the recent advent of agile software process methods a number of seldom used and unorthodox practices have come to the forefront in the field of computer programming one such practice is that of pair programming which is characterized by two programmers sharing the same computer for collaborative programming purposes the very nature of pair programming implies a psychological and social interaction between the participating programmers and thus brings into play a unique element that we do not see with the conventional individual programming model this paper focuses on the effects that one of these psychosocial factors a programmer s personality type may have on the pair programming environment in this study a group of university students 68 undergraduate students and 60 master s degree graduate students each of whom had been personality type profiled using the myers briggs type indicator mbti model was split into three sub groups one group consisted of subjects who were alike in mbti type another group consisted of subjects who were opposite to each other in mbti type and the last group was comprised of subjects who were diverse partially alike and partially opposite in mbti type through two pair programming sessions the pairs in each group were assessed for their output in code productivity the result showed that the sub group of subjects who were diverse in mbti type exhibited higher productivity than both alike and opposite groups in a comparison between alike and opposite groups the productivity of the opposite group was greater than that of the alike group pair programming team programming collaborative programming myers briggs type indicator personality,279,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of learning style preference on learning C++ language, especially i n terms of the quality of codes written and the number of errors made in programming. A total of 120 computing students were involved in this seven-week study. They were randomly assigned to either a group that received the metaphor with pair programming (MPP), to another group that received pair programming (PP) only, or to a third group that received only the metaphor instruction (MI). Participants in both the MPP and PP groups worked in pairs based on the visual-verbal learning style dimension, and those in the MI group worked individually when completing programming tasks. Two computer programming coursework were used to measure the student's coding performance. The results indicated that visual students in the MPP group performed significantly better in the quality of codes and made fewer mistakes during coding than those in the PP and MI groups. Also, the MPP method did help the verbal students to excel in C++ coding as compared to the PP and MI groups. The direct correlation was observed between their quality of codes and the number of errors. Metaphors helped the visual students in developing deeper conceptual understanding by linking the known to the newly acquired concepts. In pair programming approach, the verbal students developed better understanding through peer discussions. The understanding of individual learning style is needed in order to enhance coding performance as robustness of a programme is correlated with the accuracy of statements in the programming. learning style, computer programming, metaphor, pair programming",learning style metaphor and pair programming do they influence performance the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of learning style preference on learning c language especially i n terms of the quality of codes written and the number of errors made in programming a total of 120 computing students were involved in this seven week study they were randomly assigned to either a group that received the metaphor with pair programming mpp to another group that received pair programming pp only or to a third group that received only the metaphor instruction mi participants in both the mpp and pp groups worked in pairs based on the visual verbal learning style dimension and those in the mi group worked individually when completing programming tasks two computer programming coursework were used to measure the student s coding performance the results indicated that visual students in the mpp group performed significantly better in the quality of codes and made fewer mistakes during coding than those in the pp and mi groups also the mpp method did help the verbal students to excel in c coding as compared to the pp and mi groups the direct correlation was observed between their quality of codes and the number of errors metaphors helped the visual students in developing deeper conceptual understanding by linking the known to the newly acquired concepts in pair programming approach the verbal students developed better understanding through peer discussions the understanding of individual learning style is needed in order to enhance coding performance as robustness of a programme is correlated with the accuracy of statements in the programming learning style computer programming metaphor pair programming,277,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

278,0,5,9,166,"Laboratory Experiences in Software Engineering from a Constructivist Perspective In this paper we give a new interpretation, from a constructivist perspective, of two recent laboratory experiences in the context of a Software Engineering course at the University of Bologna. The two experiences were quite different both in the tools and in the modalities that were used: in one case a software product line was developed by following the rules of a role- playing game; in the second case students had to develop four software products using a process model chosen among Waterfall, Spiral, and Extreme Programming. Despite these differences, both cases can provide some evidences of the validity of the constructivist approach to teaching. In fact, from the results obtained and from the perceived experience of students emerged clearly the fact that, in both cases, the students working autonomously, in small groups and with a limited presence of a teacher, were able to build their own model of knowledge which resulted to be correct, as proved also by the good quality of the artifacts produced. Constructivism, Software Engineering, Computer Science",laboratory experiences in software engineering from a constructivist perspective in this paper we give a new interpretation from a constructivist perspective of two recent laboratory experiences in the context of a software engineering course at the university of bologna the two experiences were quite different both in the tools and in the modalities that were used in one case a software product line was developed by following the rules of a role playing game in the second case students had to develop four software products using a process model chosen among waterfall spiral and extreme programming despite these differences both cases can provide some evidences of the validity of the constructivist approach to teaching in fact from the results obtained and from the perceived experience of students emerged clearly the fact that in both cases the students working autonomously in small groups and with a limited presence of a teacher were able to build their own model of knowledge which resulted to be correct as proved also by the good quality of the artifacts produced constructivism software engineering computer science,180,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
279,0,8,8,150,"An approach to test-driven development of conceptual schemas Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an extreme programming development method in which a software system is developed in short iterations. In this paper we present the Test-Driven Conceptual Modeling (TDCM) method, which is an application of TDD for conceptual modeling, and we show how to develop a conceptual schema using it. In TDCM, a system's conceptual schema is incrementally obtained by performing three kinds of tasks: (1) Write a test the system should pass; (2) Change the schema to pass the test; and (3) Refactor the schema to improve its qualities. We also describe an integration approach of TDCM into a broad set of software development methodologies, including the Unified Process development methodology, the MDD-based approaches, the storytest-driven agile methods and the goal and scenario-oriented requirements engineering methods. We deal with schemas written in UML/OCL, but the TDCM method could be adapted to the development of schemas in other languages.

280,1,7,13,156,"The Effect of Complexity and Value on Architecture Planning in Agile Software Development A key feature of agile software development is its prioritisation of responding to changing requirements over planning ahead. If an agile development team spends too much time planning and designing architecture then responding to change will be extremely costly, while not doing enough architectural design puts the project at risk of failure. Striking the balance depends heavily on the context of the system being built, the environment and the development teams. This Grounded Theory research into how much architecture agile teams design up-front has identified system complexity as an important factor in determining how much planning a team does up-front, while system size, although related to complexity, has a much less direct impact. Furthermore, when determining how much design to do up-front, value to the customer can be a more important factor than overall development cost. Understanding these factors can help agile teams to determine how much up-front planning is appropriate for the systems they develop.

281,1,7,7,129,"How Much Architecture? Reducing the Up-Front Effort A key part of software architecture is the design of the high level structure of a software system -- an exercise in planning ahead. Agile software development methods discourage planning ahead, encapsulated by the Agile Manifesto philosophy ""[we value] responding to change over following aplan"". Development without architecture planning risks failure. This leads to an apparent paradox: how can you design an architecture while using a methodology that promotes not planning ahead? This paper introduces Grounded Theory research that is exploring the factors that affect how much architecture planning industry practitioners do up-front -- in other words, how much architecture? Early results show that the experience of the architects and predefined or template architectures both help to reduce the architectural effort required without sacrificing the benefits of a full architecture design.

282,1,11,5,266,"Considerations on Planning and Architecture In agile planning you are counting on what you know you definitely have. Depending on the type of project, you are either given a number of resources by your management to do the project, or, as in a services contract, there is a certain amount assigned for resources that you better not overspend. The time constraints will be fixed as well. On the other hand, requirements will be a moving target. Therefore the plan is fluid and includes only a rough estimate of those requirements that might be achievable in a prioritized order. Content is the parameter to adjust when adapting to change. The actual deliverable will be the best that can be accomplished within the given timeframe and with the given resources. Each team will figure out how to accomplish as much work as possible. In contrast to this, traditional waterfall project management teaches just the opposite approach: You start with gathering the list of fixed requirements, then estimate the cost and time needed to implement them. This approach ignores that in most cases, resources and dates are non-negotiable given constraints. The content delivered by the team will always be confined by the team size and available time, regardless which requirements you commit to address in your specification (Fig. 6.1). If the requirements are fixed by management as well as the dates and resources, this is neither waterfall nor agile, but simply unprofessional and a setup for failure. The team will be doomed to fall into a never-ending emergency mode, which is not sustainable and will offer quality decrease as the only way out.

283,1,11,11,181,"Identifying Implicit Architectural Dependencies Using Measures of Source Code Change Waves The principles of Agile software development are increasingly used in large software development projects, e.g. using Scrum of Scrums or combining Agile and Lean development methods. When large software products are developed by self-organized, usually feature-oriented teams, there is a risk that architectural dependencies between software components become uncontrolled. In particular there is a risk that the prescriptive architecture models in form of diagrams are outdated and implicit architectural dependencies may become more frequent than the explicit ones. In this paper we present a method for automated discovery of potential dependencies between software components based on analyzing revision history of software repositories. The result of this method is a map of implicit dependencies which is used by architects in decisions on the evolution of the architecture. The software architects can assess the validity of the dependencies and can prevent unwanted component couplings and design erosion hence minimizing the risk of post-release quality problems. Our method was evaluated in a case study at one large product at Saab Electronic Defense Systems (Saab EDS) and one large software product at Ericsson AB. measure,  metric,  mining software repositories,  quality,  dependency,  architecture,  case study,  industry",identifying implicit architectural dependencies using measures of source code change waves the principles of agile software development are increasingly used in large software development projects e g using scrum of scrums or combining agile and lean development methods when large software products are developed by self organized usually feature oriented teams there is a risk that architectural dependencies between software components become uncontrolled in particular there is a risk that the prescriptive architecture models in form of diagrams are outdated and implicit architectural dependencies may become more frequent than the explicit ones in this paper we present a method for automated discovery of potential dependencies between software components based on analyzing revision history of software repositories the result of this method is a map of implicit dependencies which is used by architects in decisions on the evolution of the architecture the software architects can assess the validity of the dependencies and can prevent unwanted component couplings and design erosion hence minimizing the risk of post release quality problems our method was evaluated in a case study at one large product at saab electronic defense systems saab eds and one large software product at ericsson ab measure metric mining software repositories quality dependency architecture case study industry,206,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
284,1,6,6,151,"Embedding Architectural Practices into Extreme Programming Today, agile methods become a popular approach to develop software systems. They try to satisfy customer, respond to changes, release in less time and achieve suitable profits for developers. XP is one of the most popular agile methods which is currently being used and different kinds of research have been accomplished about its various aspects such as pair programming. In spite of all benefits known of XP, it does not involve architectural techniques yet. As it is mentioned in many technical reports, the way to achieve high quality of system is to consider its architecture as an important matter in the development process. This paper introduces two practices in order to empower XP's development process toward improving system's architecture. The main characteristic of proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of XP in order to be compatible with XP process model and to keep its agility intact. Extreme Programming,  Software Architecture,  Architectural Practices",embedding architectural practices into extreme programming today agile methods become a popular approach to develop software systems they try to satisfy customer respond to changes release in less time and achieve suitable profits for developers xp is one of the most popular agile methods which is currently being used and different kinds of research have been accomplished about its various aspects such as pair programming in spite of all benefits known of xp it does not involve architectural techniques yet as it is mentioned in many technical reports the way to achieve high quality of system is to consider its architecture as an important matter in the development process this paper introduces two practices in order to empower xp s development process toward improving system s architecture the main characteristic of proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of xp in order to be compatible with xp process model and to keep its agility intact extreme programming software architecture architectural practices,165,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
285,1,5,10,149,"Transition to Agile Development - Rediscovery of Important Requirements Engineering Practices Many organizations have started to use agile development processes to speed up the development cycle and to improve the ability of the company in reacting to changing requirements. Adopting agile practices may happen as a revolution where all old practices are removed or as a more gradual process. In this paper, we discuss lessons learnt in two agile transition processes. Based on our experience, agile processes can be used in embedded software development for products. The challenges include the varying size of user requirements, the role of system requirements, and architecturally significant requirements. It is difficult for large organizations to be agile. Work allocation for a large number of different teams with different competencies tends to decrease speed, and increase the role of design and management. We conclude that agile development in this context needs very skilled developers and has to be a combination of new and old practices. agility,  requirements engineering,  best practices",transition to agile development rediscovery of important requirements engineering practices many organizations have started to use agile development processes to speed up the development cycle and to improve the ability of the company in reacting to changing requirements adopting agile practices may happen as a revolution where all old practices are removed or as a more gradual process in this paper we discuss lessons learnt in two agile transition processes based on our experience agile processes can be used in embedded software development for products the challenges include the varying size of user requirements the role of system requirements and architecturally significant requirements it is difficult for large organizations to be agile work allocation for a large number of different teams with different competencies tends to decrease speed and increase the role of design and management we conclude that agile development in this context needs very skilled developers and has to be a combination of new and old practices agility requirements engineering best practices,164,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Scaling agile methodologies is desired in order to bring the benefits of agile to larger, more complex projects. One way to scale agile methods is via an architecture-centric approach, in which a project is divided into smaller modules on which sub teams can use agile effectively. However, a problem with architecture-centric modifications to agile methods is the introduction of non-agile elements, for instance up-front design and integration difficulties.

291,1,12,7,145,"Flexible Working Architectures: Agile Architecting Using PPCs Software systems need software architectures to improve their scalability and maintenance. However, many agile practitioners claim that the upfront design of software architectures is an investment that does not pay off, since customers can rarely appreciate the value delivered by architectures. Furthermore, conventional architectural practices may be considered unacceptable from the Agile values and principles perspective. In this paper, the development of working architectures in agile iterations is presented as an attempt to solve the problem of designing software architectures in Agile. This contribution is based on the new concept of Plastic Partial Component (PPC). PPCs are highly malleable components that can be partially described, what increases the flexibility of architecture design. PPCs based architectures let reinforce some of the agile values and principles. Our experience of putting this contribution into practice is illustrated through the agile development of a Testing Framework for Biogas Plants.

292,1,6,10,123,"Architectural Descriptions as Boundary Objects in System and Design Work Lean and Agile processes have resolved longstanding problems in engineering communication by replacing document based communication with face-to-face collaboration, but do not yet scale to very large and heterogeneous projects. This paper proposes a compatible extension to lean and agile processes that addresses this limitation. The core idea is to adopt the view of documentation as boundary objects: shared artefacts that maintain integrity across a project's intersecting social worlds. The paper presents a case study, in which interviews with system engineers and designers were analysed to obtain requirements on an architectural description serving as boundary objects in a telecommunications project. The main result is a list of 18 empirically grounded, elementary requirements, worth considering when implementing lean and agile processes in the large.

The former emphasizes rapid, flexible development, while the latter emphasizes project and process infrastructure. Many practitioners, particularly of agile methods, tend-to view software architecture in light of the plan-driven side of the spectrum. They think that architecture-centric methods are too much work, equating them with high-ceremony processes emphasizing document production. But many elements make up a successful development approach, including process, product, technology, people, and tools. Software architecture is part of product quality and isn't tied to a particular process, technology, culture, or tool.

Little's law defines throughput as a ratio of work in process and cycle time. Increasing throughput (or productivity) requires continuously improving (that is, decreasing) cycle time while ensuring that the work-in-process limit doesn't exceed the capacity available to process the work. This article shares experiences regarding the role architecture plays in lean software management practices. Release plans that give as much emphasis to architecturally significant tasks as to feature-based high-priority functionality can achieve better outcomes by avoiding conditions that lead to wasted time and effort.

298,1,20,10,218,"Agile enterprise software development using domain-driven design and test first In this paper we present the experience gained and lessons learned when the IT department at Statoil ASA, a large Oil and Gas company in Norway, applied Domain-Driven design techniques in combination with agile software development practices to assess the software architecture of our next generation oil trading and supply chain application. Our hypothesis was that the use of object oriented techniques, domain driven design and a proper object-relational mapping tool would significantly improve the performance and reduce the code base compared with current legacy systems. The legacy system is based on several Oracle databases serving a variety of clients written in Java, Gupta Centura Team Developer and HTML. The databases have a layer of business logic written in PL/SQL offering various system services to the clients. To validate our new object-oriented software architecture, we re-implemented one of the most computationally heavy and data intensive services using Test First and Domain-Driven design techniques. The resulting software was then tested on a set of servers with a representative subset of data from the production environment. We found that using these techniques improved our software architecture with respect to performance as well as code quality when running on top of our Oracle databases.

Rally's agile engineering team delivered a very disruptive architectural change lasting nine months in parallel with three releases. This paper will show how this was done without prolonging the usual release cycles and without technically crippling our product or doing a lot of throwaway work. The main elements of our approach were: the ""sacrifice one"" pattern, incremental delivery of the architectural change when possible, technical infrastructure modifications to support incremental changes to the architecture, and addressing the biggest risk first. When we were close to finished, we added the whole team for the final push to release with the new architecture.

Application areas such as homeland security and disaster response add to the challenge because of a unique set of integration requirements; three examples are: (1) a high demand for flexibility with respect to the configuration and support of business processes to anticipate and cater to changing threat and mitigation scenarios, (2) high agility demands during both development and production to address legacy and emergent capabilities, processes, applications and technologies, (3) wide variety of trust relationships among and across stakeholders and their organizations. In this paper we report on an approach for balancing challenging integration requirements while rapidly delivering a high-quality, value added, integrated system architecture and service-based implementation infrastructure.

304,1,5,5,109,"Architecture-aware Programming in Agile Environments In this paper, we present industrial experiences made by combining two polarizing disciplines in software engineering: software architecture and agile software development. In particular, we show how architectural design decisions could be made, communicated, and sustained in an agile development environment by using a light-weight component framework. The concepts of the component framework have proven to be effective in addressing challenges such as connecting architectural design decisions to a system's implementation and making the architecture tangible for the developers. This is of utmost importance when the software is delivered in accordance with agile principles, such as, working software over comprehensive documentation, or responding to change over following a plan. Agile software development,  Component-based development",architecture aware programming in agile environments in this paper we present industrial experiences made by combining two polarizing disciplines in software engineering software architecture and agile software development in particular we show how architectural design decisions could be made communicated and sustained in an agile development environment by using a light weight component framework the concepts of the component framework have proven to be effective in addressing challenges such as connecting architectural design decisions to a system s implementation and making the architecture tangible for the developers this is of utmost importance when the software is delivered in accordance with agile principles such as working software over comprehensive documentation or responding to change over following a plan agile software development component based development,123,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

This is no surprise as few agile teams have had training in architecture practices let alone in how to create metaphors. In our experience this does not invalidate the metaphor, but rather shows that more guidance is needed in the proper use of metaphors.

306,1,10,12,126,"A Hybrid Software Architecture Evaluation Method for FDD - An Agile Process Model The software development industry suffers from the delay in project completion time due to heavy documentation requirements of traditional process models. To overcome these delays, agile process models are getting a wide acceptance and popularity in the industry. The beauty of these models is light weight documentation and heavy intercommunications. Due to an emphasis of these models on rapid development, there is an ever increasing need of architecture evaluation. A single software architecture evaluation method (SAEM) capable of preserving the agility does not exist at the moment. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid SAEM for feature driven development (FDD) agile process model. The proposed SAEM is hybrid of quality attribute workshop (QAW), architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) and active review for intermediate designs (ARID). process models,  Software architecture evaluation methods,  FDD,  QAW,  ATAM,  ARID",a hybrid software architecture evaluation method for fdd an agile process model the software development industry suffers from the delay in project completion time due to heavy documentation requirements of traditional process models to overcome these delays agile process models are getting a wide acceptance and popularity in the industry the beauty of these models is light weight documentation and heavy intercommunications due to an emphasis of these models on rapid development there is an ever increasing need of architecture evaluation a single software architecture evaluation method saem capable of preserving the agility does not exist at the moment in this paper we have proposed a hybrid saem for feature driven development fdd agile process model the proposed saem is hybrid of quality attribute workshop qaw architecture tradeoff analysis method atam and active review for intermediate designs arid process models software architecture evaluation methods fdd qaw atam arid,148,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
307,1,10,23,137,"Developer Stories: Improving Architecture in Agile Practice - How Facilitating Knowledge Management and Putting the Customer in the Drivers Seat Enables Sound Architectural Design Within the field of Software Engineering emergence of agile methods has been a hot topic since the late 90s. eXtreme Programming (XP) ([1]) was one of the first agile methods and is one of the most well-known. However research has pointed to weaknesses in XP regarding supporting development of viable architectures. To strengthen XP in this regard a new practice: Developer Stories ([2]) was introduced in 2006 - mainly based on a theoretical argumentation. This paper reports from extensive experimentation with, and elaboration of the new practice. Results from this experimentation shows that using Developer Stories increases the likelihood of developing a viable architecture through a series of deliberate choices, through creating disciplined and recurring activities that: 1) Facilitate sharing and embodying of knowledge about architectural issues, and 2) heighten visibility of refactorings for both customers and developers.

309,1,11,13,278,"The Use of Architectural Patterns in the Agile Software Development of Mobile Applications Architectural design patterns capture proven solutions of skilled designers to many recurring design problems. However, these patterns may lead to large solutions and overengineering, which are considered alarm signals from the viewpoint of agility. This paper reports the results of two case studies focusing on the adoption of architectural design patterns in agile development of mobile applications for real markets. The Agile Architecture Line Approach and Model were applied in the case studies. The used approach and model strive for a light and robust architecture design framework for mobile applications and services. In this approach, current architectural knowledge concerning available patterns and solutions will be captured during the Architecture Line Definition phase taking place before production. Based on the experience gained from the first case project, more emphasis was laid on capturing the current architectural knowledge about the patterns and solutions proven useful and effective in similar applications running on the used platform. The patterns are augmented before production with suitable supporting information so as to enable them to help inexperienced designers to improve the quality of mobile applications developed in nine-week agile projects in concordance with agile values. This paper demonstrates empirically that architectural design patterns can help to develop viable software architectures and to document them in a useful way, as applied in the challenging context of tough time-to-market demads, the mobile development environment and the J2ME platform. This paper further shows that pattern-based rationale of design decisions and architectural components can be a key success factor in designing mobile software and improving its quality. The empirical results of this paper are presented in a manner enabling practitioners to utilize the proposed solutions in similar projects.

310,1,11,15,163,"Scrum adoption and architectural extensions in developing new service applications of large financial IT systems The use of modern agile software development methods in large organisations requires tailoring agile development to the organisations' needs. This study concentrated on studying integrating software product line and agile application development in the context of large and complex financial IT systems. The study was conducted by interviewing a wide representation from the case organisation's personnel developing in-house software for the company's own use. The results indicate that the guidelines of the Scrum method for agile project management are valid also for the studied company type. However, each project in the studied company should acknowledge the constraints set by other projects and the complex technical infrastructure, data security issues and system portfolio in the organisation's product line platform. In order to promote re-use and avoid risks, means and mechanisms are needed to coordinate and synchronise multiple projects and their releases on business level, the project's compatibility with its constraints on system architecture level and the direction of software architecture on project team level.

311,1,10,11,243,"Facilitating Agile Software Development with Lean Architecture in the DCI Paradigm Both agile software development and lean architecture have been studied in the software engineering field. Combining these two approaches has also been investigated. However, the existing research and practices only present the principles but fail to develop a framework of the software development for practitioners to follow. In this paper, a framework about how naïve agile practices could be fulfilled by introducing ""lean"" practices under the DCI (Data-Context-Interaction) paradigm is proposed. Lean practice is an end-user-focused and value-centric system design. In the proposed framework, lean architecture is complementary to agile principles and disciplines and supports agile development. This paper is exploring the possibilities of how agile methods can restore its lost insights and possibly be reinforced by lean thinking. Meanwhile, it is also examined what lean can do ""beyond"" agile. A new lean approach to building domain architecture comes from Data-Context-Interaction (DCI) paradigm which facilitates to represent the domain architecture intuitively. DCI approach allows us to successfully decouple between domain and business-logic features and provides an approach for lean practitioners to design system architecture much closer to the real-world domain. It is claimed that the investment into lean and agile methodologies go hand in hand from organizational to technical aspects by tying up with lean concepts as the backbone for agile methods. How lean makes it right and how agile makes it fast with the DCI paradigm will be demonstrated with an example. The main contribution to the software development will be presented.

312,1,7,8,154,"Less is more: Architecture documentation for agile development The use of agile development methodologies in the software industry has increased significantly over the past decade. This has led to efforts to adjust these methodologies to enterprise products and complex systems' development, and specifically to combine the requirement of minimalism with the need for well-defined up-front architecture artifacts. Nevertheless, in many cases, architecture is accompanied with extensive documentation that requires significant effort to review and maintain throughout the development lifecycle. This paper presents a case study that aims at identifying difficulties architects and other stakeholders encounter when dealing with architecture documentation in agile development. The findings indicate that the architecture specification document is usually very long, complex, and not self-explanatory. In order to adjust the architecture documentation to the lean and minimal documentation approach of agile processes, we propose a considerably shorter abstract specification document, requiring reduced documentation efforts and resulting in a lean documentation that is easier to review, update, and communicate.

313,1,8,11,180,"Agile architecture methodology: Long term strategy interleaved with short term tactics Tactical agile development and strategic architectural evolution are viewed as opposite ends of the development spectrum, with the long-term value of applying an architecture-centric approach seemingly at odds with rapid development, featuring its informal documentation activities. The value of a long-term vision, or ar-chitecture, is particularly high in the context of product integra-tion and research. However, there is also benefit in rapid and early feedback on incremental deliverables, as featured in agile development. To extract the main benefits of both worlds we introduce the CA Agile Architecture (C3A) method, targeted for the architec-ture and design phases of the development life cycle. Its founda-tion is the Reference and Implementation Architecture, which features a lean one-page per component contract, as well as sev-eral abstraction levels.

314,1,10,11,137,"Adding Agility to Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method for Mapping on Crystal Agile process models have evolved in the recent past to overcome the problems associated with traditional models however, these are facing many challenges. One of these challenges is the lack of proper software architecture evaluation method (SAEM) suitable for agile process models. Our research focuses on developing a suitable SAEM for agile process models. Crystal being a light weight agile process model and architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) being a robust SAEM, we need some modifications in ATAM so that it can be mapped for Crystal. This mapping is very crucial because without proper evaluation, agile models can suffer with severe quality drawbacks as well as maintenance problems. We have excluded some phases in ATAM to make it suitable for Crystal. We also performed different surveys on agile process models and SAEM from professional and academic domains.

318,1,13,10,144,"Towards a process for architectural modelling in agile software development Agile methods and architectural modelling have been considered to be mutually exclusive. On the one hand, agile methods try to reduce overheads by avoiding activities that do not directly contribute to the immediate needs of the current project. This often leads to bad cross-project reuse. On the other hand, architectural modelling is considered a pre requisite for the systematic cross-project reuse and for the resulting increase in software developer productivity. The theme of this paper is to address the relationship between agile methods and architectural modelling and to propose a novel process for agile architectural modelling, which drives requirements elicitation through the use of patterns and components. This process is in-line with agile principles and is illustrated on an example application.

319,1,10,4,145,"Change-Impact Driven Agile Architecting Software architecture is a key factor to scale up Agile Software Development (ASD) in large software-intensive systems. Currently, software architectures are more often approached through mechanisms that enable to incrementally design and evolve software architectures (aka. agile architecting). Agile architecting should be a light-weight decision-making process, which could be achieved by providing knowledge to assist agile architects in reasoning about changes. This paper presents the novel solution of using change-impact knowledge as the main driver for agile architecting. The solution consists of a Change Impact Analysis technique and a set of models to assist agile architects in the change (decision-making) process by retrieving the change-impact architectural knowledge resulting from adding or changing features iteration after iteration. To validate our approach, we have put our solution into practice by running a project of a metering management system in electric power networks in an i-smart software factory.

320,1,14,11,297,"Agile product-line architecting in practice: A case study in smart grids Context Software Product Line Engineering implies the upfront design of a Product-Line Architecture (PLA) from which individual product applications can be engineered. The big upfront design associated with PLAs is in conflict with the current need of ``being open to change''. To make the development of product-lines more flexible and adaptable to changes, several companies are adopting Agile Product Line Engineering. However, to put Agile Product Line Engineering into practice it is still necessary to make mechanisms available to assist and guide the agile construction and evolution of PLAs. Objective This paper presents the validation of a process for ``the agile construction and evolution of product-line architectures'', called Agile Product-Line Architecting (APLA). The contribution of the APLA process is the integration of a set of models for describing, documenting, and tracing PLAs, as well as an algorithm for guiding the change decision-making process of PLAs. The APLA process is assessed to prove that assists Agile Product Line Engineering practitioners in the construction and evolution of PLAs. Method Validation is performed through a case study by using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Quantitative analysis was performed using statistics, whereas qualitative analysis was performed through interviews using constant comparison, triangulation, and supporting tools. This case study was conducted according to the guidelines of Runeson and Höst in a software factory where three projects in the domain of Smart Grids were involved. Results APLA is deployed through the Flexible-PLA modeling framework. This framework supported the successful development and evolution of the PLA of a family of power metering management applications for Smart Grids. Conclusions APLA is a well-supported solution for the agile construction and evolution of PLAs. This case study illustrates that the proposed solution for the agile construction of PLAs is viable in an industry project on Smart Grids.

321,1,7,11,227,"A Persona-Based Approach for Exploring Architecturally Significant Requirements in Agile Projects [Context and motivation] Architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) drive and constrain many aspects of the architecture. It is therefore beneficial to elicit and analyze these requirements in early phases of a project so that they can be taken into consideration during the architectural design of the system. Unfortunately failure to invest upfront effort in exploring stakeholders quality concerns, can lead to the need for significant refactoring efforts to accommodate emerging requirements. This problem is particularly evident in agile projects which are inherently incremental. [Question/Problem] Existing techniques for early discovery of ASRs, such as Win-Win and i*, are typically rejected by agile development teams as being somewhat heavy-weight. A light-weight approach is therefore needed to help developers identify and explore critical architectural concerns early in the project. [Principal ideas/results] In this paper we present the use of Architecturally-Savvy Personas (ASP-Lite). The personas are used to emerge and analyze stakeholders' quality concerns and to drive and validate the architectural design. ASP-Lite emerged from our experiences working with the requirements and architectural design of the TraceLab project. The approach proved effective for discovering, analyzing, and managing architecturally significant requirements, and then for designing a high-level architectural solution which was designed to satisfy requirements despite significant interdependencies and tradeoffs. [Contributions] This paper presents the ASP-Lite approach and describes its support for architectural design in the US$2 Million TraceLab project. personas,  architecture,  requirements,  architecturally significant requirements,  tradeoffs",a persona based approach for exploring architecturally significant requirements in agile projects context and motivation architecturally significant requirements asrs drive and constrain many aspects of the architecture it is therefore beneficial to elicit and analyze these requirements in early phases of a project so that they can be taken into consideration during the architectural design of the system unfortunately failure to invest upfront effort in exploring stakeholders quality concerns can lead to the need for significant refactoring efforts to accommodate emerging requirements this problem is particularly evident in agile projects which are inherently incremental question problem existing techniques for early discovery of asrs such as win win and i are typically rejected by agile development teams as being somewhat heavy weight a light weight approach is therefore needed to help developers identify and explore critical architectural concerns early in the project principal ideas results in this paper we present the use of architecturally savvy personas asp lite the personas are used to emerge and analyze stakeholders quality concerns and to drive and validate the architectural design asp lite emerged from our experiences working with the requirements and architectural design of the tracelab project the approach proved effective for discovering analyzing and managing architecturally significant requirements and then for designing a high level architectural solution which was designed to satisfy requirements despite significant interdependencies and tradeoffs contributions this paper presents the asp lite approach and describes its support for architectural design in the us 2 million tracelab project personas architecture requirements architecturally significant requirements tradeoffs,254,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
322,1,10,11,99,"Lightweight and Continuous Architectural Software Quality Assurance Using the aSQA Technique In this paper, we present a novel technique for assessing and prioritizing architectural quality in large-scale software development projects. The technique can be applied with relatively little effort by software architects and thus suited for agile development in which quality attributes can be assessed and prioritized, e.g., within each development sprint.

324,1,10,7,115,"Agile Security Using an Incremental Security Architecture The effective provision of security in an agile development requires a new approach: traditional security practices are bound to equally traditional development methods. However, there are concerns that security is difficult to build incrementally, and can prove prohibitively expensive to refactor. This paper describes how to grow security, organically, within an agile project, by using an incremental security architecture which evolves with the code. The architecture provides an essential bridge between system-wide security properties and implementation mechanisms, a focus for understanding security in the project, and a trigger for security refactoring. The paper also describes criteria that allow implementers to recognize when refactoring is needed, and a concrete example that contrasts incremental and `top-down' architectures.

327,1,12,9,109,"Coordination Between Global Agile Teams: From Process to Architecture Traditional process-centric software development has served software-intensive companies well for decades. During recent years, however, the trends of increased adoption of software product lines, software ecosystems and in particular global software engineering have lead to unmanageable complexity and unacceptable overhead. In this paper we present research performed at three global companies in which we studied the relation between large-scale and agile approaches to software development as well as current problems. In addition, by integrating the best practices adopted at the case study companies, we present an alternative approach: architecture-centric software engineering. This approach largely removes inter-team dependencies and provides much higher efficiency and productivity in global software development contexts.

331,1,11,15,210,"A study of enabling factors for rapid fielding combined practices to balance speed and stability Agile projects are showing greater promise in rapid fielding as compared to waterfall projects. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding what really constitutes and contributes to success. We interviewed project teams with incremental development lifecycles, from five government and commercial organizations, to gain a better understanding of success and failure factors for rapid fielding on their projects. A key area we explored involves how Agile projects deal with the pressure to rapidly deliver high-value capability, while maintaining project speed (delivering functionality to the users quickly) and product stability (providing reliable and flexible product architecture). For example, due to schedule pressure we often see a pattern of high initial velocity for weeks or months, followed by a slowing of velocity due to stability issues. Business stakeholders find this to be disruptive as the rate of capability delivery slows while the team addresses stability problems. We found that experienced practitioners, when faced with these challenges, do not apply Agile practices alone. Instead they combine practices - Agile, architecture, or other - in creative ways to respond quickly to unanticipated stability problems. In this paper, we summarize the practices practitioners we interviewed from Agile projects found most valuable and provide an overarching scenario that provides insight into how and why these practices emerge. agile software development,  architecture,  speed,  stability,  rapid fielding,  software development practices",a study of enabling factors for rapid fielding combined practices to balance speed and stability agile projects are showing greater promise in rapid fielding as compared to waterfall projects however there is a lack of clarity regarding what really constitutes and contributes to success we interviewed project teams with incremental development lifecycles from five government and commercial organizations to gain a better understanding of success and failure factors for rapid fielding on their projects a key area we explored involves how agile projects deal with the pressure to rapidly deliver high value capability while maintaining project speed delivering functionality to the users quickly and product stability providing reliable and flexible product architecture for example due to schedule pressure we often see a pattern of high initial velocity for weeks or months followed by a slowing of velocity due to stability issues business stakeholders find this to be disruptive as the rate of capability delivery slows while the team addresses stability problems we found that experienced practitioners when faced with these challenges do not apply agile practices alone instead they combine practices agile architecture or other in creative ways to respond quickly to unanticipated stability problems in this paper we summarize the practices practitioners we interviewed from agile projects found most valuable and provide an overarching scenario that provides insight into how and why these practices emerge agile software development architecture speed stability rapid fielding software development practices,237,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

However, there is also a significant concern about the role and importance of the issues related to the software architecture of a system being developed using agile approaches. There is to date little empirical evidence available on what software architecture related practices are followed by teams using agile approaches and the kinds of architectural challenges resulting from using agile approaches. This paper reports a case study aimed to empirically identify and understand the architectural practices and challenges of teams using agile approaches.

333,1,7,6,127,"Agility and Architecture: Can They Coexist? Agile development has significantly impacted industrial software development practices. However, despite its wide popularity, there's an increasing perplexity about software architecture's role and importance in agile approaches. Advocates of architecture's vital role in achieving quality goals for large software-intensive systems doubt the scalability of any development approach that doesn't pay sufficient attention to architecture. This article talks about software architecture being relevant to the basis of aspects such as communication among team members, inputs to subsequent design decisions, documenting design assumptions, and evaluating design alternatives. In a large software organization, implementing agile approaches isn't a straightforward adoption problem. Most likely, it will take several years to shorten the feedback cycles to benefit from the adaptability and earlier value-creation opportunities.
