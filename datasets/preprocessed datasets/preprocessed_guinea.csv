The register file has been previously shown to exhibit the highest temperature compared to all other hardware components in a modern high-end embedded proces- sor, which makes it particularly susceptible to faults and elevated leakage power. We show that this is mostly due to the highly clustered register file accesses where a set of few registers phys- ically placed close to each other are accessed with very high frequency. We propose compile-time temperature-aware register reallocation methodologies for breaking such groups of registers and to uniformly distribute the accesses to the register file. This is achieved with no performance and no hardware overheads. We show that the underlying problem is NP-hard, and subsequently introduce and evaluate two efficient algorithmic heuristics.

421,0,"Performance Estimation of Embedded Software with Instruction Cache Modeling Embedded systems generally interact in some way with the outside world. This may involve measuring sensors and controlling actuators, communicating with other systems, or interact- ing with users. These functions impose real-time constraints on system design. Verification of these specifications requires computing an upper bound on the worst-case execution time (WCET) of a hardware/software system. Furthermore, it is critical to derive a tight upper bound on WCET in order to make efficient use of system resources. The problem of bounding WCET is particularly difficult on modern processors. These proces- sors use cache-based memory systems that vary memory access time based on the dynamic memory access pattern of the program. This must be accurately modeled in order to tightly bound WCET. Several analysis methods have been proposed to bound WCET on processors with instruction caches. Existing approaches either search all possible program paths, an intractable problem, or they use highly pessimistic assumptions to limit the search space. In this paper we present a more effective method for modeling instruction cache activity and computing a tight bound on WCET. The method uses an integer linear programming formulation and does not require explicit enumeration of program paths. The method is implemented in the program cinderella and we present some experimental results of this implementation.

It would be hard to find any other technology that is more undervalued scientifically and at the same time has bigger impact on the presence and future of engineered systems. The unique challenges in CPS integration emerge from the heterogeneity of components and interactions. This heterogeneity drives the need for modeling and analyzing cross-domain interactions among physical and computational/networking domains and demands deep understanding of the effects of heterogeneous abstraction layers in the design flow. To address the challenges of CPS integration, significant progress needs to be made toward a new science and technology foundation that is model based, precise, and predictable. This paper presents a theory of composition for heterogeneous systems focusing on stability. Specifically, the paper presents a passivity-based design approach that decouples stability from timing uncertainties caused by networking and computation. In addition, the paper describes cross-domain abstractions that provide effective solution for model-based fully automated software synthesis and high-fidelity performance analysis. The design objectives demonstrated using the techniques presented in the paper are group coordination for networked unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and high-confidence embedded control software design for a quadrotor UAV.

426,0,"Economical and Balanced Energy Usage in the Smart Home Infrastructure: A Tutorial and New Results The smart home infrastructure features the automatic control of various household appliances in the advanced metering infrastructure, which enables the connection of individual smart home systems to a smart grid. In such an infrastructure, each smart meter receives electricity price from utilities and uses a smart controller to schedule the household appliances accordingly. This helps shift the heavy energy load from peak hours to nonpeak hours. Such an architecture significantly improves the reliability of the power grid through reducing the peak energy usage, while benefiting the customers through reducing electricity bills. This paper presents a tutorial on the development of the smart controller to schedule household appliances, which is also known as smart home scheduling. For each individual user, a dynamic programming-based algorithm that schedules household appliances with discrete power levels is introduced. Based on it, a game theoretic framework is designed for multi-user smart home scheduling to mitigate the accumulated energy usage during the peak hours. The simulation results demonstrate that it can reduce the electricity bill by 30.11% while still improving peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in the power grid.

Applications are deployed to processors that are shared amongst control and noncontrol tasks, to maximize resource utilization. This potentially overlooks that computing mechanisms meant for improving average CPU usage, such as cache, interrupts, and task management through schedulers, contribute to nondeterministic interference between tasks. This response time jitter can result in reduced system stability, motivating further study by both the controls and computing communities to maximize CPU utilization, while maintaining physical system stability needs.

428,0,"A Novel Cyber Physical System for 3-D Imaging of the Small Intestine In Vivo Small intestine is the longest organ in the gastrointestinal tract where much of the digestion and the food absorption take place. Wireless video capsule endoscope (VCE) is the first device taking 2-D pictures from the lesions and the abnormalities in the entire length of the small intestine. Since precise localization and mapping inside the small intestine is a very challenging problem, we cannot measure the distance traveled by the VCE to associate lesions and abnormalities to locations inside the small intestine, and we cannot use the 2-D pictures to reconstruct the 3-D image of interior of the entire small intestine in vivo. This paper presents the architectural concept of a novel cyber physical system (CPS), which can utilize the 2-D pictures of the small intestine taken by the VCE to reconstruct the 3-D image of the small intestine in vivo. Hybrid localization and mapping techniques with millimetric accuracy for inside the small intestine is presented as an enabling technology to facilitate the reconstruction of 3-D images from the 2-D pictures. The proposed CPS architecture provides for large-scale virtual experimentations inside the human body without intruding the body with a sizable equipment using reasonable clinical experiments for validation.

430,0,"Home Automation Oriented Gesture Classification From Inertial Measurements In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach is presented that exploits accelerometers data to deal with gesture recognition (GR) problems. The proposed methodology aims at providing high accuracy classification for home automation systems, which are generally user independent, device independent, and device orientation independent, an heterogeneous scenario that has not been fully investigated in previous GR literature. The approach illustrated in this paper is composed of three main steps: event identification; feature extraction; and ML-based classification. The elements of the novelty of the proposed approach are 1) a preprocessing phase based on principal component analysis to increase the performance in real-world scenario conditions and 2) the development of parsimonious novel classification techniques based on sparse Bayesian learning. This methodology is tested on two datasets of four gesture classes (horizontal, vertical, circles, and eight-shaped movements) and on a further dataset with eight classes. In order to authentically describe a real-world home automation environment, the gesture movements are collected from more than 30 people who freely perform any gesture.

This orphan problem of ZigBee might bring a big confusion to a home automation environment in which a number of consumer devices are interconnected in the multi-hop manner.

438,0,"Sensing-Driven Energy Purchasing in Smart Grid Cyber-Physical System Distributed and renewable-energy resources are likely to play an important role in the future energy landscape as consumers and enterprise energy users reduce their reliance on the main electricity grid as their source of electricity. Environmental or ambient sensing of parameters such as temperature and humidity, and amount of sunlight and wind, can be used to predict electricity demand from users and supply from renewable sources, respectively. In this paper, we describe a Smart Grid Cyber-Physical System (SG-CPS) comprising sensors that transmit real-time streams of sensed information to predictors of demand and supply of electricity and an optimization-based decision maker that uses these predictions together with real-time grid electricity prices and historical information to determine the quantity and timing of grid electricity purchases throughout the day and night. We investigate two forms of the optimization-based decision maker, one that uses linear programming and another that uses multi-stage stochastic programming. Our results show that sensing-driven predictions combined with the optimization-based purchasing decision maker hosted on the SG-CPS platform can cope well with uncertainties in demand, supply, and electricity prices and make grid electricity purchasing decisions that successfully keep both the occurrence of electricity shortfalls and the cost of grid electricity purchases low.

These devices can include doors, lights, surveillance systems, and consumer electronics. A user can control a variety of home devices with the help of a home automation system. To provide mobility, a mobile phone-based home automation has been developed. As another approach toward home automation, an Internet-based home automation system has been proposed, providing a graphic user interface. However, these systems lack userfriendliness and are neither intuitive nor realistic. To improve the user-friendliness of the interface, a 3D view interface was designed.

Smart grid initiatives are moving power systems curricula toward smart grids. Although the components of smart grids fall within the broader discipline of electrical and computer engineering, undergraduate students are rarely assigned single design projects that require classic power systems knowledge combined with communication, computing, and control. Therefore, as a significant step toward potential curriculum changes, this paper presents such a project, a smart home test bed based on the pedagogical model of project-based learning (PBL) for undergraduate education. The proposed test bed allows undergraduates to gain key knowledge in smart grid topics, such as flattening demand peaks, real-time price response, wireless sensor networks, machine learning, pattern recognition, embedded system programming, user interface design, circuit design, and databases.

For each audio frame, important atoms from the Gabor dictionary are selected by using the Matching Pursuit algorithm. After the system disregards phase and position information, the scale and frequency of the atoms are extracted to construct a scale-frequency map. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) are then applied to the scale-frequency map, subsequently generating the proposed feature.

455,0,"Bio-inspired ant colony optimization based clustering algorithm with mobile sinks for applications in consumer home automation networks With the fast development of wireless communications, ZigBee and semiconductor devices, home automation networks have recently become very popular. Since typical consumer products deployed in home automation networks are often powered by tiny and limited batteries, one of the most challenging research issues is concerning energy reduction and the balancing of energy consumption across the network in order to prolong the home network lifetime for consumer devices. The introduction of clustering and sink mobility techniques into home automation networks have been shown to be an efficient way to improve the network performance and have received significant research attention. Taking inspiration from nature, this paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based clustering algorithm specifically with mobile sink support for home automation networks. In this work, the network is divided into several clusters and cluster heads are selected within each cluster. Then, a mobile sink communicates with each cluster head to collect data directly through short range communications. The ACO algorithm has been utilized in this work in order to find the optimal mobility trajectory for the mobile sink. Extensive simulation results from this research show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves home network performance when using mobile sinks in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime as compared to other routing algorithms currently deployed for home automation networks. ant colony optimisation, home automation, home networks, mobility management (mobile radio), power consumption, telecommunication power management, consumer home automation networks, bio-inspired ant colony optimization, clustering algorithm, mobile sinks, energy reduction, energy consumption, sink mobility, cluster head, short range communications, optimal mobility trajectory, network lifetime, Sensors, Home automation, Clustering algorithms, Mobile communication, Algorithm design and analysis, Wireless sensor networks, Energy consumption, Ant Colony Optimization, Clustering, HomeAutomation Networks, Sink Mobility",bio inspired ant colony optimization based clustering algorithm with mobile sinks for applications in consumer home automation networks with the fast development of wireless communications zigbee and semiconductor devices home automation networks have recently become very popular since typical consumer products deployed in home automation networks are often powered by tiny and limited batteries one of the most challenging research issues is concerning energy reduction and the balancing of energy consumption across the network in order to prolong the home network lifetime for consumer devices the introduction of clustering and sink mobility techniques into home automation networks have been shown to be an efficient way to improve the network performance and have received significant research attention taking inspiration from nature this paper proposes an ant colony optimization aco based clustering algorithm specifically with mobile sink support for home automation networks in this work the network is divided into several clusters and cluster heads are selected within each cluster then a mobile sink communicates with each cluster head to collect data directly through short range communications the aco algorithm has been utilized in this work in order to find the optimal mobility trajectory for the mobile sink extensive simulation results from this research show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves home network performance when using mobile sinks in terms of energy consumption and network lifetime as compared to other routing algorithms currently deployed for home automation networks ant colony optimisation home automation home networks mobility management mobile radio power consumption telecommunication power management consumer home automation networks bio inspired ant colony optimization clustering algorithm mobile sinks energy reduction energy consumption sink mobility cluster head short range communications optimal mobility trajectory network lifetime sensors home automation clustering algorithms mobile communication algorithm design and analysis wireless sensor networks energy consumption ant colony optimization clustering homeautomation networks sink mobility,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
456,0,"An efficient data fusion and assurance mechanism using temporal and spatial correlations for home automation networks In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate data fusion mechanism through temporal and spatial correlations for Home Automation Networks. Data fusion is a process to decrease the transmission number of similar sensory values, thus its importance is in the spotlight because energy efficiency is a main issue on the networks. In order to reduce the transmission amount of data, each device decides whether to send new sensing data or not after comparing it with previous sensing values(temporal correlation) and the last transmitted value of the neighbor device(spatial correlation) which is a one-hop range via a predetermined user threshold. Our mechanism includes a commit and assurance process for security enhancement. For the performance evaluation of our mechanism, we use the temperature data measured on real networks and extend them using Gaussian distribution in order to obtain the more test data sets. The simulation results show that using both types of correlations is more efficient than just using one type for data fusion in terms of the data transmission amount and accuracy.

457,0,"A Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Leveraging Probabilistic Detection of Energy Theft in Smart Home In the modern smart home and community, smart meters have been massively deployed for the replacement of traditional analog meters. Although it significantly reduces the cost of data collection as the meter readings are wireless transmitted, a smart meter is not tamper-resistant. As a consequence, the smart grid infrastructure is under threat of energy theft, by means of attacking a smart meter so that it undercounts the electricity usage. Deployment of feeder remote terminal unit (FRTU) helps narrow the search zone of energy theft in smart home and community. However, due to budgetary limit, utility companies can only afford to insert the minimum number of FRTUs. This imposes a signifcant challenge to deploy the minimum number of FRTUs while each smart meter is still effectively monitored. To the best of our knowledge, the only work addressing this problem is [1], which uses stochastic optimization methods. Their algorithm is not very practical as it cannot handle large distribution networks because of the scalability issue. Due to the inherent heuristic and non-deterministic nature, there is no guarantee on the solution quality as well. Thus, the high performance energy theft detection is still needed for this energy theft problem. In order to resolve this challenge, we propose a new dynamic programming algorithm that inserts the minimum number of FRTUs satisfying the detection rate constraint. It evaluates every candidate solution in a bottom-up fashion using an innovative pruning technique. As a deterministic polynomial time algorithm, it is able to handle large distribution networks. In contrast to [1] which can only handle small system, our technique can perform FRTU insertion for a large scale power system. Our experimental results demonstrate that the average number of FRTUs required is only 26% of the number of smart meters in the community. Compared with the previous work, the number of FRTUs is reduced by 18.8% while the solution quality in terms of anomaly coverage index metric is still improved. computational complexity, dynamic programming, home automation, probability, smart meters, stochastic programming, probabilistic detection leveraging, smart home, smart meters, data collection cost reduction, wireless transmitted, meter readings, smart grid infrastructure, electricity usage, feeder remote terminal unit deployment, FRTU deployment, energy theft search zone, utility companies, stochastic optimization methods, dynamic programming algorithm, detection rate constraint, bottom-up method, pruning technique, deterministic polynomial time algorithm, large-distribution network handling, FRTU insertion, large scale power system, anomaly coverage index metric, solution quality improvement, Smart meters, Heuristic algorithms, Circuit synthesis, Dynamic programming, Monitoring, Energy management, Probabilistic Detection, Energy Theft, Smart Home and Community, Dynamic Programming, FRTU, Probabilistic detection, energy theft, smart home and community, dynamic programming, FRTU",a dynamic programming algorithm for leveraging probabilistic detection of energy theft in smart home in the modern smart home and community smart meters have been massively deployed for the replacement of traditional analog meters although it significantly reduces the cost of data collection as the meter readings are wireless transmitted a smart meter is not tamper resistant as a consequence the smart grid infrastructure is under threat of energy theft by means of attacking a smart meter so that it undercounts the electricity usage deployment of feeder remote terminal unit frtu helps narrow the search zone of energy theft in smart home and community however due to budgetary limit utility companies can only afford to insert the minimum number of frtus this imposes a signifcant challenge to deploy the minimum number of frtus while each smart meter is still effectively monitored to the best of our knowledge the only work addressing this problem is 1 which uses stochastic optimization methods their algorithm is not very practical as it cannot handle large distribution networks because of the scalability issue due to the inherent heuristic and non deterministic nature there is no guarantee on the solution quality as well thus the high performance energy theft detection is still needed for this energy theft problem in order to resolve this challenge we propose a new dynamic programming algorithm that inserts the minimum number of frtus satisfying the detection rate constraint it evaluates every candidate solution in a bottom up fashion using an innovative pruning technique as a deterministic polynomial time algorithm it is able to handle large distribution networks in contrast to 1 which can only handle small system our technique can perform frtu insertion for a large scale power system our experimental results demonstrate that the average number of frtus required is only 26 of the number of smart meters in the community compared with the previous work the number of frtus is reduced by 18 8 while the solution quality in terms of anomaly coverage index metric is still improved computational complexity dynamic programming home automation probability smart meters stochastic programming probabilistic detection leveraging smart home smart meters data collection cost reduction wireless transmitted meter readings smart grid infrastructure electricity usage feeder remote terminal unit deployment frtu deployment energy theft search zone utility companies stochastic optimization methods dynamic programming algorithm detection rate constraint bottom up method pruning technique deterministic polynomial time algorithm large distribution network handling frtu insertion large scale power system anomaly coverage index metric solution quality improvement smart meters heuristic algorithms circuit synthesis dynamic programming monitoring energy management probabilistic detection energy theft smart home and community dynamic programming frtu probabilistic detection energy theft smart home and community dynamic programming frtu,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

An EHA information model is formulated through the activity recognition, case comprehension, and assistive action layers.

In the sound separation phase, we present a convolutive blind source separation system with source number estimation using time-frequency clustering. An accurate mixing matrix can be estimated by the proposed phase compensation technique and used for reconstructing the separated sound sources.

The proposed scheme is to increase the life time of the sensor network with the integrated gateway node.

464,0,"Intrusion Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems: Techniques and Challenges Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate the computation with physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques.

The accomplishment of this task requires formal models that handle the involved entities as autonomous logic-based agents and provide methods for handling the imperfect and distributed nature of context. This paper proposes a solution based on the Multi-Context Systems paradigm in which local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories (contexts), and information flow between agents is achieved through mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts. To handle imperfect context, we extend Multi-Context Systems with nonmonotonic features: local defeasible theories, defeasible mapping rules, and a preference ordering on the system contexts. On top of this model, we have developed an argumentation framework that exploits context and preference information to resolve potential conflicts caused by the interaction of ambient agents through the mappings, and a distributed algorithm for query evaluation. cooperative systems, inference mechanisms, defeasible contextual reasoning, ambient intelligence, context information, formal models, autonomous logic based agents, multicontext systems paradigm, ambient agents, rule theories, distributed algorithm, query evaluation, ambient agents interaction, Ambient intelligence, Context modeling, Pervasive computing, Artificial intelligence, Wireless communication, Distributed algorithms, Query processing, Intelligent agent, Software agents, Humans, Ambient Intelligence, contextual reasoning, defeasible reasoning, argumentation systems.",defeasible contextual reasoning with arguments in ambient intelligence the imperfect nature of context in ambient intelligence environments and the special characteristics of the entities that possess and share the available context information render contextual reasoning a very challenging task the accomplishment of this task requires formal models that handle the involved entities as autonomous logic based agents and provide methods for handling the imperfect and distributed nature of context this paper proposes a solution based on the multi context systems paradigm in which local context knowledge of ambient agents is encoded in rule theories contexts and information flow between agents is achieved through mapping rules that associate concepts used by different contexts to handle imperfect context we extend multi context systems with nonmonotonic features local defeasible theories defeasible mapping rules and a preference ordering on the system contexts on top of this model we have developed an argumentation framework that exploits context and preference information to resolve potential conflicts caused by the interaction of ambient agents through the mappings and a distributed algorithm for query evaluation cooperative systems inference mechanisms defeasible contextual reasoning ambient intelligence context information formal models autonomous logic based agents multicontext systems paradigm ambient agents rule theories distributed algorithm query evaluation ambient agents interaction ambient intelligence context modeling pervasive computing artificial intelligence wireless communication distributed algorithms query processing intelligent agent software agents humans ambient intelligence contextual reasoning defeasible reasoning argumentation systems,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
466,0,"Modular Simulation-Based Physical and Emotional Assessment of Ambient Intelligence in Traffic In this letter, we detail a modular approach for measuring the secondary physical and emotional effects of ambient intelligence (AmI) technology in traffic. Using the case of merges on to a highway, we assess the results of a system that advises the driver to change early to a lane on the left to create space for merging cars downstream (tested using a cellular automata simulation). The indirect impact of the system downstream, namely how the remaining lane changes from the merge lane to the innermost lane proceed, is then evaluated using a time-discrete, space-continuous microscopic traffic simulation tool. This yields detailed results concerning driver interactions that can also be used to derive an estimate of driver anger in the situation. We have used real geographic, traffic and psychological data to test the system, and different models are used to accomplish various tasks. The approach yields (surprisingly) negative results concerning the indirect emotional impact of this AmI intervention which may be due to the nature of the lane changing model used and the chosen parameters.

471,0,"Efficient medium access control for cyber--physical systems with heterogeneous networks A cyber-physical system (CPS) consists of a group of interlinked networked objects. CPSs are characteristically different from the traditional internetworked systems (e.g., Internet) due to the operating environment and their applications, which impose high reliability constraints on them. One of the fundamental considerations for enabling this technology is the medium access control (MAC). The traditional IEEE 802.11-based MAC layer solutions need to be revamped. In order to increase the efficiency of data transmission, we introduce a new approach, which argues the replacement of the traditional backoff algorithm of 802.11. The proposed approach attempts to address some of the obligations posed by CPS networks. At the core of the proposed solution is the introduction of the adaptability factor to the traditional backoff procedure, which can help CPS networks operate under diverse environmental conditions. In order to survive the high degrees of dynamism of these networks, each of the nodes is equipped with a learning automaton, which adapts to the changing environment and provides the node with the most optimized value. The consistent outperformance of the proposed approach when compared with similar existing approaches under different simulation scenarios exhibits its efficacy.

472,0,"Efficient Rule Engine for Smart Building Systems In smart building systems, the automatic control of devices relies on matching the sensed environment information to customized rules. With the development of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs), low-cost and self-organized wireless sensors and actuators can enhance smart building systems, but produce abundant sensing data. Therefore, a rule engine with ability of efficient rule matching is the foundation of WSANs based smart building systems. However, traditional rule engines mainly focus on the complex processing mechanism and omit the amount of sensing data, which are not suitable for large scale WSANs based smart building systems. To address these issues, we build an efficient rule engine. Specifically, we design an atomic event extraction module for extracting atomic event from data messages, and then build a β-network to acquire the atomic conditions for parsing the atomic trigger events. Taking the atomic trigger events as the key set of MPHF, we construct the minimal perfect hash table which can filter the majority of the unused atomic event with O(1) time overhead. Moreover, a rule engine adaption scheme is proposed to minimize the rule matching overhead. We implement the proposed rule engine in a practical smart building system. The experimental results show that the rule engine can perform efficiently and flexibly with high data throughput and large rule set. actuators, building management systems, computational complexity, file organisation, network theory (graphs), pattern matching, wireless sensor networks, automatic control, sensed environment information matching, customized rules, wireless sensor and actuator networks, low-cost self-organized wireless sensors, rule matching, WSAN based smart building systems, complex processing mechanism, sensing data, atomic event extraction module, β-network, MPHF, minimal perfect hash table, unused atomic event, O(1) time overhead, rule matching overhead, Engines, Smart buildings, Algorithm design and analysis, Actuators, Filtering, Data mining, Temperature sensors, Smart building system, rule engine, rule matching, minimal perfect hash function.",efficient rule engine for smart building systems in smart building systems the automatic control of devices relies on matching the sensed environment information to customized rules with the development of wireless sensor and actuator networks wsans low cost and self organized wireless sensors and actuators can enhance smart building systems but produce abundant sensing data therefore a rule engine with ability of efficient rule matching is the foundation of wsans based smart building systems however traditional rule engines mainly focus on the complex processing mechanism and omit the amount of sensing data which are not suitable for large scale wsans based smart building systems to address these issues we build an efficient rule engine specifically we design an atomic event extraction module for extracting atomic event from data messages and then build a network to acquire the atomic conditions for parsing the atomic trigger events taking the atomic trigger events as the key set of mphf we construct the minimal perfect hash table which can filter the majority of the unused atomic event with o 1 time overhead moreover a rule engine adaption scheme is proposed to minimize the rule matching overhead we implement the proposed rule engine in a practical smart building system the experimental results show that the rule engine can perform efficiently and flexibly with high data throughput and large rule set actuators building management systems computational complexity file organisation network theory graphs pattern matching wireless sensor networks automatic control sensed environment information matching customized rules wireless sensor and actuator networks low cost self organized wireless sensors rule matching wsan based smart building systems complex processing mechanism sensing data atomic event extraction module network mphf minimal perfect hash table unused atomic event o 1 time overhead rule matching overhead engines smart buildings algorithm design and analysis actuators filtering data mining temperature sensors smart building system rule engine rule matching minimal perfect hash function,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

These cyber devices may be tightly coupled with the physical processes they control and human induced failures risk dire real-world consequences. Dynamic virtual honeypots are effective tools for observing and attracting network intruder activity. This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario.

488,0,"Coordinated Scheduling of Residential Distributed Energy Resources to Optimize Smart Home Energy Services We describe algorithmic enhancements to a decision-support tool that residential consumers can utilize to optimize their acquisition of electrical energy services. The decision-support tool optimizes energy services provision by enabling end users to first assign values to desired energy services, and then scheduling their available distributed energy resources (DER) to maximize net benefits. We chose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near-optimal schedules within manageable computation times. We improve the basic formulation of cooperative PSO by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles. The improved DER schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated DER scheduling. This is computed by comparing the end-user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all DER, against the costs when each DER schedule is solved separately. This comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs, available DER and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem, or instead, decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations. decision support systems, energy conservation, energy management systems, energy resources, home automation, particle swarm optimisation, power distribution planning, stochastic processes, decision support tool, residential consumer, electrical energy services, distributed energy resources, particle swarm optimization, near optimal schedule, PSO, stochastic repulsion, DER, coordinated scheduling problem, Smart Home, Energy resources, Smart homes, Density estimation robust algorithm, Processor scheduling, Costs, Scheduling algorithm, Energy management, Particle swarm optimization, Stochastic processes, Smart grids, Coevolutionary PSO, distributed energy resources, energy management, energy services, home automation, optimization methods, repulsive PSO, value of coordination",coordinated scheduling of residential distributed energy resources to optimize smart home energy services we describe algorithmic enhancements to a decision support tool that residential consumers can utilize to optimize their acquisition of electrical energy services the decision support tool optimizes energy services provision by enabling end users to first assign values to desired energy services and then scheduling their available distributed energy resources der to maximize net benefits we chose particle swarm optimization pso to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near optimal schedules within manageable computation times we improve the basic formulation of cooperative pso by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles the improved der schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated der scheduling this is computed by comparing the end user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all der against the costs when each der schedule is solved separately this comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs available der and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem or instead decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations decision support systems energy conservation energy management systems energy resources home automation particle swarm optimisation power distribution planning stochastic processes decision support tool residential consumer electrical energy services distributed energy resources particle swarm optimization near optimal schedule pso stochastic repulsion der coordinated scheduling problem smart home energy resources smart homes density estimation robust algorithm processor scheduling costs scheduling algorithm energy management particle swarm optimization stochastic processes smart grids coevolutionary pso distributed energy resources energy management energy services home automation optimization methods repulsive pso value of coordination,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

491,0,"D-Pro: Dynamic Data Center Operations With Demand-Responsive Electricity Prices in Smart Grid The study of today's cyber-physical system (CPS) has been an important research area. Internet data centers (IDCs) are energy consuming CPSs that support the reliable operations of many important online services. Along with the increasing Internet services and cloud computing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations had been surging significantly. Such mass power consumption has brought extremely heavy burden on IDC operators. While most previous work only consider about dynamical optimization of IDC under electricity markets, the reaction of IDC toward electricity market has been overlooked. Due to the fact that IDCs are usually large-volume users in the electricity market, they might have market power to affect the electricity price. In this paper, we study how to address the challenge of interactions between IDC operation and electricity market price. To this end, we propose a supply function to model the market power of IDC and formulate a total electricity cost minimization problem as a non-linear programming. Then we present CMC algorithm inspired by the economics concept. CMC algorithm not only solves the optimization problem efficiently, but also uncovers the impetus of the work load distribution. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize the total electricity cost of IDCs by adaptively handling the interaction between IDCs and smart grid. cloud computing, computer centres, nonlinear programming, power engineering computing, power markets, pricing, smart power grids, D-Pro, dynamic data center operations, demand responsive electricity prices, smart grid, cyber-physical system, Internet data centers, IDC, cloud computing, power usage, electricity markets, total electricity cost minimization problem, nonlinear programming, load distribution, Electricity, Electricity supply industry, Servers, Optimization, Minimization, Internet, Corrected marginal cost (CMC), cyber-physical system (CPS), electricity market, Internet data centers (IDC), supply curve",d pro dynamic data center operations with demand responsive electricity prices in smart grid the study of today s cyber physical system cps has been an important research area internet data centers idcs are energy consuming cpss that support the reliable operations of many important online services along with the increasing internet services and cloud computing in recent years the power usage associated with idc operations had been surging significantly such mass power consumption has brought extremely heavy burden on idc operators while most previous work only consider about dynamical optimization of idc under electricity markets the reaction of idc toward electricity market has been overlooked due to the fact that idcs are usually large volume users in the electricity market they might have market power to affect the electricity price in this paper we study how to address the challenge of interactions between idc operation and electricity market price to this end we propose a supply function to model the market power of idc and formulate a total electricity cost minimization problem as a non linear programming then we present cmc algorithm inspired by the economics concept cmc algorithm not only solves the optimization problem efficiently but also uncovers the impetus of the work load distribution extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize the total electricity cost of idcs by adaptively handling the interaction between idcs and smart grid cloud computing computer centres nonlinear programming power engineering computing power markets pricing smart power grids d pro dynamic data center operations demand responsive electricity prices smart grid cyber physical system internet data centers idc cloud computing power usage electricity markets total electricity cost minimization problem nonlinear programming load distribution electricity electricity supply industry servers optimization minimization internet corrected marginal cost cmc cyber physical system cps electricity market internet data centers idc supply curve,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
492,0,"Aviation Cyber--Physical Systems: Foundations for Future Aircraft and Air Transport A century of revolutionary growth in aviation has made global travel a reality of daily life. Aircraft and air transport overcame a number of formidable challenges and hostilities in the physical world. Success in this arduous pursuit was not without leveraging advances of the ``cyber'' layer, i.e., digital computing, data storage and networking, and software, in hardware, infrastructures, humans, and processes, within the airframe, in space, and on the ground. The physical world, however, is evolving continuously in the 21st century, contributing traffic growth and diversity, fossil fuel and ozone layer depletion, demographics and economy dynamics, as some major factors in aviation performance equations. In the next 100 years, apart from breakthrough physical advances, such as aircraft structural and electrical designs, we envision aviation's progress will depend on conquering cyberspace challenges and adversities, while safely and securely transitioning cyber benefits to the physical world.

493,0,"Adaptive Negotiation Agent for Facilitating Bi-Directional Energy Trading Between Smart Building and Utility Grid Smart and green buildings have attracted much attention in recent years. Development of an effective negotiation model for facilitating the bi-directional energy trading between the utility grid and the building is important for enhancing the building intelligence. In this paper, a negotiation agent based on adaptive attitude bidding strategy (AABS) is proposed. A comprehensive set of factors for the integrated smart building and utility grid system is taken into account in developing the negotiation model. The AABS based negotiation agent turns out to be able to dynamically adjust its behavior in response to varying attitudes in the negotiation process. In addition, an improved particle swarm optimization-adaptive attitude bidding strategy (PSO-AABS) based negotiation agent is developed for adaptively adjusting the trader's decisions according to the opponent's behaviors.

494,0,"Obstacle avoidance routing scheme through optimal sink movement for home monitoring and mobile robotic consumer devices In recent years, ZigBee has been proven to be an excellent solution to create scalable and flexible home automation networks. In a home automation network, consumer devices typically collect data from a home monitoring environment and then transmit the data to an end user through multi-hop communication without the need for any human intervention. However, due to the presence of typical obstacles in a home environment, error-free reception may not be possible, particularly for power constrained devices. A mobile sink based data transmission scheme can be one solution but obstacles create significant complexities for the sink movement path determination process. Therefore, an obstacle avoidance data routing scheme is of vital importance to the design of an efficient home automation system. This paper presents a mobile sink based obstacle avoidance routing scheme for a home monitoring system. The mobile sink collects data by traversing through the obstacle avoidance path. Through ZigBee based hardware implementation and verification, the proposed scheme successfully transmits data through the obstacle avoidance path to improve network performance in terms of life span, energy consumption and reliability.

495,0,"WSNHA-GAHR: a greedy and A* heuristic routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks in home automation The use of wireless sensor networks in home automation (WSNHA) is a growing trend, on account of their self-organisation, low cost and potential for rapid deployment. Routing in WSNHA is a challenging research topic, because of the requirements of low energy consumption, low storage, low computational complexity, fast response, self-adaptation to unpredictable topological changes and robustness with respect to discontinuous interference. With the development of localisation techniques, localised routing offers a number of attractive benefits, but not all are suitable for WSNHA. In this study, the authors propose a new routing algorithm for WSNHA, called WSNHA-GAHR (greedy andA* heuristic routing for WSNHA). The algorithm uses greedy forwarding, based on the smallest Euclidean distance, to minimise the number of hops for data packet transmission, and thus conserve energy. It also automatically adjusts the route, using theA* heuristic algorithm, when local minimum problems and unpredictable topological changes occur in WSNHA. In addition, link priority classification gives WSNHA-GAHR a greater tolerance than ZigBee routing algorithm for discontinuous interference. Simulation results show that this routing protocol dramatically improves reliability and reduces average packet delay, without introducing additional overhead. computational complexity, delays, greedy algorithms, heuristic programming, home automation, interference suppression, radiofrequency interference, routing protocols, telecommunication computing, wireless sensor networks, Zigbee, wireless sensor network, home automation, energy consumption, computational complexity, robustness, interference, localisation technique, greedy and A  heuristic routing algorithm, GAHR, greedy forwarding, Euclidean distance, data packet transmission, link priority classification, ZigBee routing algorithm, routing protocol, average packet delay",wsnha gahr a greedy and a heuristic routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks in home automation the use of wireless sensor networks in home automation wsnha is a growing trend on account of their self organisation low cost and potential for rapid deployment routing in wsnha is a challenging research topic because of the requirements of low energy consumption low storage low computational complexity fast response self adaptation to unpredictable topological changes and robustness with respect to discontinuous interference with the development of localisation techniques localised routing offers a number of attractive benefits but not all are suitable for wsnha in this study the authors propose a new routing algorithm for wsnha called wsnha gahr greedy anda heuristic routing for wsnha the algorithm uses greedy forwarding based on the smallest euclidean distance to minimise the number of hops for data packet transmission and thus conserve energy it also automatically adjusts the route using thea heuristic algorithm when local minimum problems and unpredictable topological changes occur in wsnha in addition link priority classification gives wsnha gahr a greater tolerance than zigbee routing algorithm for discontinuous interference simulation results show that this routing protocol dramatically improves reliability and reduces average packet delay without introducing additional overhead computational complexity delays greedy algorithms heuristic programming home automation interference suppression radiofrequency interference routing protocols telecommunication computing wireless sensor networks zigbee wireless sensor network home automation energy consumption computational complexity robustness interference localisation technique greedy and a heuristic routing algorithm gahr greedy forwarding euclidean distance data packet transmission link priority classification zigbee routing algorithm routing protocol average packet delay,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
496,0,"Ubiquitous Monitoring for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Over Relay- Assisted Wireless Sensor Networks Ubiquitous monitoring over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is of increasing interest in industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Question of how to understand a situation of physical system by estimating process parameters is largely unexplored. This paper is concerned with the distributed estimation problem for industrial automation over relay-assisted WSNs. Different from most existing works on WSN with homogeneous sensor nodes, the network considered in this paper consists of two types of nodes, i.e., sensing nodes (SNs), which is capable of sensing and computing, and relay nodes (RNs), which is only capable of simple data aggregation. We first adopt a Kalman filtering (KF) approach to estimate the unknown physical parameters. In order to facilitate the decentralized implementation of the KF algorithm in relay-assisted WSNs, a tree-based broadcasting strategy is provided for distributed sensor fusion. With the fused information, the consensus-based estimation algorithms are proposed for SNs and RNs, respectively. The proposed method is applied to estimate the slab temperature distribution in a hot rolling process monitoring system, which is a typical industrial CPS. It is demonstrated that the introduction of RNs improves temperature estimation efficiency and accuracy compared with the homogeneous WSN with SNs only. hot rolling, Kalman filters, monitoring, parameter estimation, relay networks (telecommunication), temperature distribution, ubiquitous computing, wireless sensor networks, ubiquitous monitoring, industrial cyber-physical systems, relay-assisted wireless sensor networks, distributed estimation problem, industrial automation, sensing nodes, relay nodes, Kalman filtering, tree-based broadcasting strategy, slab temperature distribution, hot rolling process monitoring system, temperature estimation efficiency, Estimation, Wireless sensor networks, Relays, Tin, Monitoring, Kalman filters, Sensors, Cyber-Physical System, Ubiquitous monitoring, Wireless sensor network, Relay, Consensus, Estimation, Cyber-physical system, ubiquitous monitoring, wireless sensor network, relay, consensus, estimation",ubiquitous monitoring for industrial cyber physical systems over relay assisted wireless sensor networks ubiquitous monitoring over wireless sensor networks wsns is of increasing interest in industrial cyber physical systems cpss question of how to understand a situation of physical system by estimating process parameters is largely unexplored this paper is concerned with the distributed estimation problem for industrial automation over relay assisted wsns different from most existing works on wsn with homogeneous sensor nodes the network considered in this paper consists of two types of nodes i e sensing nodes sns which is capable of sensing and computing and relay nodes rns which is only capable of simple data aggregation we first adopt a kalman filtering kf approach to estimate the unknown physical parameters in order to facilitate the decentralized implementation of the kf algorithm in relay assisted wsns a tree based broadcasting strategy is provided for distributed sensor fusion with the fused information the consensus based estimation algorithms are proposed for sns and rns respectively the proposed method is applied to estimate the slab temperature distribution in a hot rolling process monitoring system which is a typical industrial cps it is demonstrated that the introduction of rns improves temperature estimation efficiency and accuracy compared with the homogeneous wsn with sns only hot rolling kalman filters monitoring parameter estimation relay networks telecommunication temperature distribution ubiquitous computing wireless sensor networks ubiquitous monitoring industrial cyber physical systems relay assisted wireless sensor networks distributed estimation problem industrial automation sensing nodes relay nodes kalman filtering tree based broadcasting strategy slab temperature distribution hot rolling process monitoring system temperature estimation efficiency estimation wireless sensor networks relays tin monitoring kalman filters sensors cyber physical system ubiquitous monitoring wireless sensor network relay consensus estimation cyber physical system ubiquitous monitoring wireless sensor network relay consensus estimation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
497,0,"Distributed Data Traffic Scheduling With Awareness of Dynamics State in Cyber Physical Systems With Application in Smart Grid The design of communication infrastructure in cyber physical system (CPS) is of vital importance for proper operations of physical dynamics. In this paper, the scheduling of packet transmission over wireless communication networks in CPS is studied for the purpose of system state stabilization. To measure the effective information amount of different packets, the concept of virtual queue (VQ) is defined based on the delay-tolerant Kalman filtering. VQ-based back pressure algorithm is proposed for the distributed data traffic scheduling. The impact of transmission delays on VQ lengths is also studied for the formulation of distributed scheduling strategy. The scheduling method is then applied in the context of voltage control in microgrid and is demonstrated to achieve better performance than general scheduling algorithm without the awareness of dynamics state.

498,0,"Information Fusion to Defend Intentional Attack in Internet of Things Robust network design against attacks is one of the most fundamental issues in Internet of Things (IoT) architecture as IoT operations highly rely on the support of the underlaying communication infrastructures. In this paper, the vulnerability of IoT infrastructure under intentional attacks is investigated by relating the network resilience to the percolation-based connectivity. Intentional attacks impose severe threats on the network operations as it can effectively disrupt a network by paralyzing a small fraction of nodes, and therefore deteriorating IoT operations. A fusion-based defense mechanism is proposed to mitigate the damage caused by such attacks, where each node feedbacks minimum (one-bit) local decision to the fusion center for attack inference. By formulating the attack and defense strategy as a zero-sum game, the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. The robustness of the Internet-oriented and the cyber-physical system (CPS)-oriented networks are specifically analyzed to illustrate the foundation of future IoT infrastructure.

500,0,"Inhabitants Tracking System in a Cluttered Home Environment Via Floor Load Sensors Home automation systems should evolve to the next phase in which they are aware of contexts, because providing services based on contexts will upgrade the service quality, thus making people more comfortable and home living more convenient. In particular, location is a piece of important and useful context information for seeking appropriate services, as well as providing them to people living in a home. So far, there have been several studies focused on tracking inhabitants in smart home environments. However, these approaches are often intrusive or require inhabitants to wear some sort of devices, which may make the inhabitants uncomfortable or even inconvenient. This problem could devastate the ultimate goal, which is to provide convenient services, and hence cause such approaches somewhat controversial. In this study, we utilize a number of load sensors together to construct a sensory floor on which exerted pressure can be detected and cover its surface with wooden flooring as in a normal home environment. Although the wooden flooring provides a flat surface for inhabitants to walk on, it also causes clutter in the sensor readings, which lead to difficulty in clearly identifying the location(s) of pressure source(s). Thus, we apply probabilistic data association technique and LeZi-Update approach to analyze the cluttered pressure readings collected by the load sensors so as to determine the positions of the inhabitants, as well as to track their movements. With our nonintrusive approach, there is no need for inhabitants to wear any devices, and this also solves the cross-walking problem in the home environment. Note to Practitioners-This system aims for detecting the location of multiple inhabitants in the home environment. We adopt the sensory floor as our tracking sensor, which consists of many blocks, each with a load cell to collect the human body weight.

504,0,"Cyber-Physical Modeling and Cyber-Contingency Assessment of Hierarchical Control Systems Online closed-loop hierarchical control systems (HCSs) are widely used in power-system operation. Like typical cyber-physical systems, the contingencies on the cyber side of an HCS may lead to inappropriate control commands, which will influence the physical power system. To evaluate the degree to which these inappropriate control commands influence the power system, we propose a cyber-physical equivalent model for HCSs. In this model, the HCS cyber network is abstracted to a directed graph consisting of data nodes and directed branches, and connectivity is described by using a node-branch incidence matrix. Using this strategy, we can describe the general information flow in an HCS using mathematical equations on the basis of which quantitative evaluation can be carried out. Furthermore, by using existing operation records, several kinds of typical cyber-contingencies are also modeled on the basis of which cyber-contingency assessment (cyber-CA) can be implemented by using a model-based approach. Considering the computational efficiency, such an approach keeps only key characteristics of the information flow rather than all features of the cyber network. In the case study, a coordinated secondary-voltage control system is studied as an example. The physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies on different data transmission and processing modules are compared.

510,0,"Dynamic Sign Language Recognition for Smart Home Interactive Application Using Stochastic Linear Formal Grammar This paper presents the state-of-the art dynamic sign language recognition (DSLR) system for smart home interactive applications. Our novel DSLR system comprises two main subsystems: an image processing (IP) module and a stochastic linear formal grammar (SLFG) module. Our IP module enables us to recognize the individual words of the sign language (i.e., a single gesture). In this module, we used the bag-of-features (BOFs) and a local part model approach for bare hand dynamic gesture recognition from a video. We used dense sampling to extract local 3-D multiscale whole-part features. We adopted 3-D histograms of a gradient orientation descriptor to represent features. The k-means++ method was applied to cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification was conducted using the BOFs and nonlinear support vector machine methods. We used a multiscale local part model to preserve temporal context. The SLFG module analyzes the sentences of the sign language (i.e., sequences of gestures) and determines whether or not they are syntactically valid. Therefore, the DSLR system is not only able to rule out ungrammatical sentences, but it can also make predictions about missing gestures, which, in turn, increases the accuracy of our recognition task.

512,0,"Detecting Human Behavior Models From Multimodal Observation in a Smart Home This paper addresses learning and recognition of human behavior models from multimodal observation in a smart home environment. The proposed approach is part of a framework for acquiring a high-level contextual model for human behavior in an augmented environment. A 3-D video tracking system creates and tracks entities (persons) in the scene. Further, a speech activity detector analyzes audio streams coming from head set microphones and determines for each entity, whether the entity speaks or not. An ambient sound detector detects noises in the environment. An individual role detector derives basic activity like ldquowalkingrdquo or ldquointeracting with tablerdquo from the extracted entity properties of the 3-D tracker. From the derived multimodal observations, different situations like ldquoaperitifrdquo or ldquopresentationrdquo are learned and detected using statistical models (HMMs). The objective of the proposed general framework is two-fold: the automatic offline analysis of human behavior recordings and the online detection of learned human behavior models. To evaluate the proposed approach, several multimodal recordings showing different situations have been conducted. The obtained results, in particular for offline analysis, are very good, showing that multimodality as well as multiperson observation generation are beneficial for situation recognition. behavioural sciences, hidden Markov models, home automation, social aspects of automation, ubiquitous computing, video recording, learned human behavior model, smart home, augmented environment, 3D video tracking system, speech activity detector, audio streams, head set microphones, ambient sound detector, noise detection, individual role detector, statistical models, hidden Markov model, situation recognition, Humans, Smart homes, Detectors, Speech analysis, Context modeling, Layout, Streaming media, Microphones, Acoustic noise, Working environment noise, Context-awareness, human-centered computing, individual role detection, multimodal human behavior modeling and detection, situation modeling",detecting human behavior models from multimodal observation in a smart home this paper addresses learning and recognition of human behavior models from multimodal observation in a smart home environment the proposed approach is part of a framework for acquiring a high level contextual model for human behavior in an augmented environment a 3 d video tracking system creates and tracks entities persons in the scene further a speech activity detector analyzes audio streams coming from head set microphones and determines for each entity whether the entity speaks or not an ambient sound detector detects noises in the environment an individual role detector derives basic activity like ldquowalkingrdquo or ldquointeracting with tablerdquo from the extracted entity properties of the 3 d tracker from the derived multimodal observations different situations like ldquoaperitifrdquo or ldquopresentationrdquo are learned and detected using statistical models hmms the objective of the proposed general framework is two fold the automatic offline analysis of human behavior recordings and the online detection of learned human behavior models to evaluate the proposed approach several multimodal recordings showing different situations have been conducted the obtained results in particular for offline analysis are very good showing that multimodality as well as multiperson observation generation are beneficial for situation recognition behavioural sciences hidden markov models home automation social aspects of automation ubiquitous computing video recording learned human behavior model smart home augmented environment 3d video tracking system speech activity detector audio streams head set microphones ambient sound detector noise detection individual role detector statistical models hidden markov model situation recognition humans smart homes detectors speech analysis context modeling layout streaming media microphones acoustic noise working environment noise context awareness human centered computing individual role detection multimodal human behavior modeling and detection situation modeling,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

515,0,"Demand Response Optimization for Smart Home Scheduling Under Real-Time Pricing Demand response (DR) is very important in the future smart grid, aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours. However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an L1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional L1 regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation. binary decision diagrams, combinatorial mathematics, convex programming, domestic appliances, integer programming, load management, power system economics, pricing, scheduling, demand response optimization, smart home energy scheduling, real-time pricing, smart grid, peak load hour, binary decision variable, mixed integer combinatorial problem, convex programming, DR optimization, automatic load management, household appliance, L1 regularization technique, schedule-based appliance, SA, mixed integer transform problem, standard CP problem, Home appliances, Optimization, Electricity, Schedules, Energy management, Smart homes, Energy consumption, Convex programming, demand response, energy consumption scheduling, energy management,  $L_1$ regularization, smart home",demand response optimization for smart home scheduling under real time pricing demand response dr is very important in the future smart grid aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours however if binary decision variables are needed to specify start up time of a particular appliance the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve in this paper we study a versatile convex programming cp dr optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home in particular an l1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule based appliances sas for which their on off statuses are governed by binary decision variables by relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values the problem is reformulated as a new cp problem with an additional l1 regularization term in the objective this allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard cp problem its major advantage is that the overall dr optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently moreover a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of sas and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed cp formulation binary decision diagrams combinatorial mathematics convex programming domestic appliances integer programming load management power system economics pricing scheduling demand response optimization smart home energy scheduling real time pricing smart grid peak load hour binary decision variable mixed integer combinatorial problem convex programming dr optimization automatic load management household appliance l1 regularization technique schedule based appliance sa mixed integer transform problem standard cp problem home appliances optimization electricity schedules energy management smart homes energy consumption convex programming demand response energy consumption scheduling energy management l 1 regularization smart home,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

519,0,"Integrated Impedance-Matching Coupler for Smart Building and Other Power-Line Communications Applications Power-line communications is a promising technology to help automate buildings, since it utilizes the in situ power cabling as a communications channel. However, couplers are required to inject and extract the communication signal from the power grid. Most power-line communications couplers make use of a small transformer to adapt impedance levels while also providing galvanic isolation. The cost and size of these transformers have been hindrances in the quest for compact, economic couplers. Previous attempts to eliminate this coupling transformer, while maintaining impedance adaptation, have not been successful in reducing component cost or physical size. In this paper, a novel approach is followed: 1) a suitable dual-function bandpass matching circuit is designed for ordinary electronics, whereafter 2) the specifications of this bandpass matching circuit are upgraded to function safely in the power-grid environment as a coupler.

A first step in understanding how to protect such systems requires an understanding of emergent weaknesses, in part, due to the cyber-physical coupling. In this paper, we present a framework that models a class of cyber-physical switching vulnerabilities in smart grid systems. Variable structure system theory is employed to effectively characterize the cyber-physical interaction of the smart grid and demonstrate how existence of the switching vulnerability is dependent on the local structure of the power grid. We identify and demonstrate how through successful cyber intrusion and local knowledge of the grid an opponent can compute and apply a coordinated switching sequence to a circuit breaker to disrupt operation within a short interval of time.

528,0,"On Design and Implementation of Neural-Machine Interface for Artificial Legs The quality-of-life of leg amputees can be improved dramatically by using a cyber-physical system (CPS) that controls artificial legs based on neural signals representing amputees' intended movements. The key to the CPS is the neural-machine interface (NMI) that senses electromyographic (EMG) signals to make control decisions. This paper presents a design and implementation of a novel NMI using an embedded computer system to collect neural signals from a physical system-a leg amputee, provide adequate computational capability to interpret such signals, and make decisions to identify user's intent for prostheses control in real time. A new deciphering algorithm, composed of an EMG pattern classifier and a postprocessing scheme, was developed to identify the user's intended lower limb movements. To deal with environmental uncertainty, a trust management mechanism was designed to handle unexpected sensor failures and signal disturbances. Integrating the neural deciphering algorithm with the trust management mechanism resulted in a highly accurate and reliable software system for neural control of artificial legs.

530,0,"Automatic Design of an Indoor User Location Infrastructure Using a Memetic Multiobjective Approach Services in ambient intelligence (AmI) environments should adapt to contextual information (context-aware) of users and environment in a nonintrusive and natural way. Location-aware, i.e., the user location, is one of the most important pieces in context-aware. According to this premise, a location-based service (LBS) using radio frequency identification technology is presented. The service is based on hidden Markov models for location within an intelligent building. This problem leads to a multiobjective optimization problem, in which, the best configuration of antennas that minimizes the set of antennas but maximizes the precision of the prediction should be found. Specifically, this study presents a memetic approach for multiobjective improvement of LBS in AmI environments. The memetic algorithm provides, in this problem, the exploitation of domain knowledge and the combination of metaheuristics.

534,0,"Zone-aware service system with nomadic resources for cost-effective pervasive infrastructure The context-aware service system (CASS) for smart home services has received considerable attention due to advances made in context-awareness technologies. In recent years, various context-aware consumer electronics for intelligent and personalized user-centric services have been introduced. However, the conventional CASS has architectural limitations, including low availability, low interoperability, and low scalability. For example, it is difficult to modify or update the context-aware service (CAS) infrastructure once it has been built. Therefore, this paper proposes a zone-aware service system (ZASS) for cost-effective pervasive infrastructure. The main component of the ZASS is a zone-aware service agent (ZASA) which utilizes the user's nomadic resource as a sensor or gateway. The term `user's nomadic resource' refers to the user's hand-held device, which has a sensing or networking capability, such as a smartphone, smart watch, and mobile sensor, etc. As the utilization of the user's nomadic resource, the ZASS can be cost-effectively implemented compared with the conventional CASS.

Much pioneering work has tried to figure out how epidemic routing using network coding (ERNC) performs in VCPS, either by simulation or by analysis. However, none of them has been able to expose the potential of ERNC accurately.

536,0,"Distributed Smart-Home Decision-Making in a Hierarchical Interactive Smart Grid Architecture In this paper, we develop a comprehensive real-time interactive framework for the utility and customers in a smart grid while ensuring grid-stability and quality-of-service (QoS). First, we propose a hierarchical architecture for the utility-customer interaction consisting of sub-components of customer load prediction, renewable generation integration, power-load balancing and demand response (DR). Within this hierarchical architecture, we focus on the problem of real-time scheduling in an abstract grid model consisting of one controller and multiple customer units. A scalable solution to the real-time scheduling problem is proposed by combining solutions to two sub-problems: (1) centralized sequential decision making at the controller to maximize an accumulated reward for the whole micro-grid and (2) distributed auctioning among all customers based on the optimal load profile obtained by solving the first problem to coordinate their interactions. We formulate the centralized sequential decision making at the controller as a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP). Next, a Vikrey auctioning game is designed to coordinate the actions of the individual smart-homes to actually achieve the optimal solution derived by the controller under realistic gird interaction assumptions. We show that though truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for all smart-homes in the auctioning game, collusive equilibria do exist and can jeopardize the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading opportunity allocation. Analysis on the structure of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution set shows that the Vickrey auctioning game can be made more robust against collusion by customers (anticipating distributed smart-homes) by introducing a positive reserve price. The corresponding auctioning game is then shown to converge to the unique incentive compatible truthful bidding Bayesian Nash equilibrium, without jeopardizing the auctioneer's (microgrid controller's) profit. The paper also explicitly discusses how this two-step solution approach can be scaled to be suitable for more complicated smart grid architectures beyond the assumed abstract model. decision making, distributed power generation, game theory, hidden Markov models, power generation control, power system stability, quality of service, scheduling, smart power grids, distributed smart-home decision-making, hierarchical interactive smart grid architecture, grid-stability, quality-of-service, QoS, utility-customer interaction, customer load prediction, renewable generation integration, power-load balancing, demand response, real-time scheduling, abstract grid model, centralized sequential decision making, hidden mode Markov decision process, HM-MDP, Vikrey auctioning game, Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution set, microgrid, Microgrids, Smart grids, Real-time systems, Decision making, Planning, Games, Load modeling, Bayesian Nash equilibria, hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP), hierarchical architecture, microgrid, resource pooling, smart-home, truthful bidding strategy, utility-customer interaction, Vickrey auction",distributed smart home decision making in a hierarchical interactive smart grid architecture in this paper we develop a comprehensive real time interactive framework for the utility and customers in a smart grid while ensuring grid stability and quality of service qos first we propose a hierarchical architecture for the utility customer interaction consisting of sub components of customer load prediction renewable generation integration power load balancing and demand response dr within this hierarchical architecture we focus on the problem of real time scheduling in an abstract grid model consisting of one controller and multiple customer units a scalable solution to the real time scheduling problem is proposed by combining solutions to two sub problems 1 centralized sequential decision making at the controller to maximize an accumulated reward for the whole micro grid and 2 distributed auctioning among all customers based on the optimal load profile obtained by solving the first problem to coordinate their interactions we formulate the centralized sequential decision making at the controller as a hidden mode markov decision process hm mdp next a vikrey auctioning game is designed to coordinate the actions of the individual smart homes to actually achieve the optimal solution derived by the controller under realistic gird interaction assumptions we show that though truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for all smart homes in the auctioning game collusive equilibria do exist and can jeopardize the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading opportunity allocation analysis on the structure of the bayesian nash equilibrium solution set shows that the vickrey auctioning game can be made more robust against collusion by customers anticipating distributed smart homes by introducing a positive reserve price the corresponding auctioning game is then shown to converge to the unique incentive compatible truthful bidding bayesian nash equilibrium without jeopardizing the auctioneer s microgrid controller s profit the paper also explicitly discusses how this two step solution approach can be scaled to be suitable for more complicated smart grid architectures beyond the assumed abstract model decision making distributed power generation game theory hidden markov models power generation control power system stability quality of service scheduling smart power grids distributed smart home decision making hierarchical interactive smart grid architecture grid stability quality of service qos utility customer interaction customer load prediction renewable generation integration power load balancing demand response real time scheduling abstract grid model centralized sequential decision making hidden mode markov decision process hm mdp vikrey auctioning game bayesian nash equilibrium solution set microgrid microgrids smart grids real time systems decision making planning games load modeling bayesian nash equilibria hidden mode markov decision process hm mdp hierarchical architecture microgrid resource pooling smart home truthful bidding strategy utility customer interaction vickrey auction,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
537,0,"Regularized Deconvolution-Based Approaches for Estimating Room Occupancies We address the problem of estimating the number of people in a room using information available in standard HVAC systems. We propose an estimation scheme based on two phases. In the first phase, we assume the availability of pilot data and identify a model for the dynamic relations occurring between occupancy levels, CO2concentration and room temperature. In the second phase, we make use of the identified model to formulate the occupancy estimation task as a deconvolution problem. In particular, we aim at obtaining an estimated occupancy pattern by trading off between adherence to the current measurements and regularity of the pattern. To achieve this goal, we employ a special instance of the so-called fused lasso estimator, which promotes piecewise constant estimates by including an ℓ1norm-dependent term in the associated cost function. We extend the proposed estimator to include different sources of information, such as actuation of the ventilation system and door opening/closing events. We also provide conditions under which the occupancy estimator provides correct estimates within a guaranteed probability. We test the estimator running experiments on a real testbed, in order to compare it with other occupancy estimation techniques and assess the value of having additional information sources. Note to Practitioners - Home automation systems benefit from automatic recognition of human presence in the built environment. Since dedicated hardware is costly, it may be preferable to detect occupancy with software-based systems which do not require the installation of additional devices. The object of this study is the reconstruction of occupancy patterns in a room using measurements of concentration, temperature, fresh air inflow, and door opening/closing events. All these signals are information sources often available in HVAC systems of modern buildings and homes. We assess the value of such information sources in terms of their relevance in detecting occupancy in small and medium-sized rooms. The proposed estimation scheme is composed of two distinct phases. The first is a training phase where the goal is to derive a mathematical model relating the number of occupants with the concentration. It is required to record the actual occupants in the room for a time period spanning few days, a task that can be performed either with manual logging or with temporary dedicated hardware counting systems. In a second phase, we use the derived model to design an online software which collects measurements of the environmental signals and provides the number of people currently in the room. The estimated occupancy levels can then be employed to enhance the efficiency of the HVAC system of the building. We notice that, in modern residential buildings composed by structurally equal flats, the training phase can be run in one flat only, since the obtained model will be reasonably valid for the other flats. home automation, HVAC, probability, regularized deconvolution-based approach, HVAC system, occupancy level, CO2concentration, room temperature, occupancy estimation task, fused lasso estimator, cost function, ventilation system, probability, occupancy estimation techniques, home automation system, information sources, mathematical model, time period spanning, manual logging, Estimation, Temperature measurement, System identification, Air conditioning, Deconvolution, Deconvolution, occupancy estimation, regularization, system identification",regularized deconvolution based approaches for estimating room occupancies we address the problem of estimating the number of people in a room using information available in standard hvac systems we propose an estimation scheme based on two phases in the first phase we assume the availability of pilot data and identify a model for the dynamic relations occurring between occupancy levels co2concentration and room temperature in the second phase we make use of the identified model to formulate the occupancy estimation task as a deconvolution problem in particular we aim at obtaining an estimated occupancy pattern by trading off between adherence to the current measurements and regularity of the pattern to achieve this goal we employ a special instance of the so called fused lasso estimator which promotes piecewise constant estimates by including an 1norm dependent term in the associated cost function we extend the proposed estimator to include different sources of information such as actuation of the ventilation system and door opening closing events we also provide conditions under which the occupancy estimator provides correct estimates within a guaranteed probability we test the estimator running experiments on a real testbed in order to compare it with other occupancy estimation techniques and assess the value of having additional information sources note to practitioners home automation systems benefit from automatic recognition of human presence in the built environment since dedicated hardware is costly it may be preferable to detect occupancy with software based systems which do not require the installation of additional devices the object of this study is the reconstruction of occupancy patterns in a room using measurements of concentration temperature fresh air inflow and door opening closing events all these signals are information sources often available in hvac systems of modern buildings and homes we assess the value of such information sources in terms of their relevance in detecting occupancy in small and medium sized rooms the proposed estimation scheme is composed of two distinct phases the first is a training phase where the goal is to derive a mathematical model relating the number of occupants with the concentration it is required to record the actual occupants in the room for a time period spanning few days a task that can be performed either with manual logging or with temporary dedicated hardware counting systems in a second phase we use the derived model to design an online software which collects measurements of the environmental signals and provides the number of people currently in the room the estimated occupancy levels can then be employed to enhance the efficiency of the hvac system of the building we notice that in modern residential buildings composed by structurally equal flats the training phase can be run in one flat only since the obtained model will be reasonably valid for the other flats home automation hvac probability regularized deconvolution based approach hvac system occupancy level co2concentration room temperature occupancy estimation task fused lasso estimator cost function ventilation system probability occupancy estimation techniques home automation system information sources mathematical model time period spanning manual logging estimation temperature measurement system identification air conditioning deconvolution deconvolution occupancy estimation regularization system identification,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
538,0,"Mobile agent-based cross-layer anomaly detection in smart home sensor networks using fuzzy logic Despite the rapid advancements in consumer electronics, the data transmitted by sensing devices in a smart home environment are still vulnerable to anomalies due to node faults, transmission errors, or attacks. This affects the reliability of the received sensed data and may lead to the incorrect decision making at both local (i.e., smart home) and global (i.e., smart city) levels. This study introduces a novel mobile agent-based cross-layer anomaly detection scheme, which takes into account stochastic variability in cross-layer data obtained from received data packets, and defines fuzzy logic-based soft boundaries to characterize behavior of sensor nodes. This cross-layer design approach empowers the proposed scheme to detect both node and link anomalies, and also effectively transmits mobile agents by considering the communication link-state before transmission of the mobile agent. The proposed scheme is implemented on a real testbed and a modular application software is developed to manage the anomaly detection system in the smart home.

541,0,"Fault Diagnosis in the Automotive Electric Power Generation and Storage System (EPGS) In this paper, we present an initial study to develop fault detection and isolation techniques for the vehicle systems that are controlled by a network of electronic control units (ECUs). The root causes of the faults include hardware components such as actuators, software within the controllers (ECUs), or the interactions between hardware and software, i.e., between controllers and plants. These faults, originating from various interactions and especially between hardware and software, are particularly challenging to address. Our basic strategy is to divide the fault universe of the cyber-physical system in a hierarchical manner, and monitor the critical variables/signals that have impact at different levels of interactions. Diagnostic matrix is established to represent the relationship between the faults and the test outcomes (also known as fault signatures). A factorial hidden Markov model-based inference algorithm, termed dynamic multiple fault diagnosis, is used to infer the root causes based on the observed test outcomes. The proposed diagnostic strategy is validated on an electrical power generation and storage system controlled by two ECUs in an environment with CANoe/MATLAB co-simulation. Eleven faults are injected with the failures originating in actuator hardware, sensor, controller hardware, and software components (sensor faults are not considered in this paper).

546,0,"Gender-Driven Emotion Recognition Through Speech Signals For Ambient Intelligence Applications This paper proposes a system that allows recognizing a person's emotional state starting from audio signal registrations. The provided solution is aimed at improving the interaction among humans and computers, thus allowing effective human-computer intelligent interaction. The system is able to recognize six emotions(anger, boredom, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) and the neutral state. This set of emotional states is widely used for emotion recognition purposes. It also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the other possible ones, as proven in the proposed numerical results. The system is composed of two subsystems: 1) gender recognition(GR) and 2) emotion recognition(ER). The experimental analysis shows the performance in terms of accuracy of the proposed ER system.

To support service requirements analysis of real-world applications for services computing, this paper presents a situation-theoretic approach to human-intention-driven service evolution in context-aware service environments. In this study, we give situation a definition that is rich in semantics and useful for modeling and reasoning human intentions, whereas the definition of intention is based on the observations of situations. A novel computational framework is described that allows us to model and infer human intentions by detecting the desires of an individual as well as capturing the corresponding context values through observations. An inference process based on hidden Markov model makes instant definition of individualized services at runtime possible, and significantly, shortens service evolution cycle.

Attaining a common temperature set-point that is agreeable to all users (occupants) in such a multi-occupant space is a challenging problem. Furthermore, the ideal temperature set-point should optimally trade off the building energy cost with the aggregate discomfort of all the occupants. However, the information on the comfort range (function) is held privately by each occupant. Using occupant-differentiated dynamically-adjusted penalty factor as feedback signals, we propose a distributed solution which ensures that a consensus is attained among all occupants upon convergence, irrespective of their ideal temperature preferences being in coherence or conflicting. Occupants are only assumed to be rational, in that they choose their own temperature set-points so as to minimize their individual energy cost plus discomfort. We establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal temperature set-point vector that minimizes the sum of the energy cost and the aggregate discomfort of all occupants in a multizone building.

557,0,"Calibration of Etched Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor Arrays for Measurement of Molecular Surface Adsorption Etched Fiber Bragg Grating (EFBG) sensors are attractive from the point of the inherently high multiplexing ability of fiber based sensors. However, the strong dependence of the sensitivity of EFBG sensors on the fiber diameter requires robust methods for calibration when used for distributed sensing in a large array format. Using experimental data and numerical modelling, we show that knowledge of the wavelength shift during the etch process is necessary for high-fidelity calibration of EFBG arrays. However as this approach requires the monitoring of every element of the sensor array during etching, we also proposed and demonstrated a calibration scheme using data from bulk refractometry measurements conducted post-fabrication without needing any information about the etching process. Although this approach is not as precise as the first one, it may be more practical as there is no requirement to monitor each element of the sensor array. We were able to calibrate the response of the sensors to within 3% with the approach using information acquired during etching and to within 5% using the post-fabrication bulk refractometry approach in spite of the sensitivities of the array element differing by more than a factor of 4.

Prior literature in EFBG based refractive index sensing predominantly deals with bulk refractometry only, where the Bragg wavelength shift of the sensor as a function of the bulk refractive index of the sample can be analytically modeled, unlike the situation for adsorption of molecular thin films on the sensor surface. We used a finite element model to calculate the Bragg wavelength change as a function of thickness and refractive index of the adsorbing molecular layer and compared the model with the real-time, in-situ measurement of electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of weak polyelectrolytes on the silica surface of EFBGs. We then used this model to calculate the layer thickness of LbL films and found them to be in agreement with literature. Further, we used this model to arrive at a realistic estimate of the limit of detection of EFBG sensors based on nominal measurement noise levels in current FBG interrogation systems and found that sufficiently thinned EFBGs can provide a competitive platform for real-time measurement of molecular interactions while simultaneously leveraging the high multiplexing capabilities of fiber optics. adsorption, Bragg gratings, etching, fibre optic sensors, finite element analysis, optical fibre cladding, optical fibres, polymer electrolytes, refractive index, etched fiber Bragg grating sensors, detection limit, FBG, clad etched FBG, refractometry, Bragg wavelength shift, bulk refractive index, finite element model, adsorbing molecular layer, electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly, weak polyelectrolytes, EFBG, layer thickness, LbL films, nominal measurement noise levels, multiplexing, surface adsorption sensing, Sensors, Numerical models, Adsorption, Refractive index, Fiber gratings, Assembly, Etched fiber Bragg grating, layer by layer assembly, limit of detection, weak polyelectrolytes",detection limit of etched fiber bragg grating sensors while fiber bragg grating fbg sensors have been extensively used for temperature and strain sensing clad etched fbgs efbgs have only recently been explored for refractive index sensing prior literature in efbg based refractive index sensing predominantly deals with bulk refractometry only where the bragg wavelength shift of the sensor as a function of the bulk refractive index of the sample can be analytically modeled unlike the situation for adsorption of molecular thin films on the sensor surface we used a finite element model to calculate the bragg wavelength change as a function of thickness and refractive index of the adsorbing molecular layer and compared the model with the real time in situ measurement of electrostatic layer by layer lbl assembly of weak polyelectrolytes on the silica surface of efbgs we then used this model to calculate the layer thickness of lbl films and found them to be in agreement with literature further we used this model to arrive at a realistic estimate of the limit of detection of efbg sensors based on nominal measurement noise levels in current fbg interrogation systems and found that sufficiently thinned efbgs can provide a competitive platform for real time measurement of molecular interactions while simultaneously leveraging the high multiplexing capabilities of fiber optics adsorption bragg gratings etching fibre optic sensors finite element analysis optical fibre cladding optical fibres polymer electrolytes refractive index etched fiber bragg grating sensors detection limit fbg clad etched fbg refractometry bragg wavelength shift bulk refractive index finite element model adsorbing molecular layer electrostatic layer by layer assembly weak polyelectrolytes efbg layer thickness lbl films nominal measurement noise levels multiplexing surface adsorption sensing sensors numerical models adsorption refractive index fiber gratings assembly etched fiber bragg grating layer by layer assembly limit of detection weak polyelectrolytes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Medical devices, electronic braking systems in automotive applications, and industrial control systems are examples of the many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that utilize these computing capabilities. Given the potential consequences of software related failures in such systems, a high degree of safety, security, and reliability is often required. Programming languages are important tools used by programmers to develop CPS. They provide a programmer with the ability to transform designs into machine code. Of equal importance is their ability to detect and avoid programming mistakes. The development of CPS has predominantly been accomplished using the C programming language.

In the proposed scheme, home agents prioritize their decisions based on the expected utilities they provide.

This paper focuses on one important set of such safety rules: Proper-Temporal-Embedding (PTE), where distributed CPS entities must enter/leave risky states according to properly nested temporal pattern and certain duration spacing. Our solution introduces hybrid automata to formally describe and analyze CPS design patterns. We propose a novel leasing based design pattern, along with closed-form configuration constraints, to guarantee PTE safety rules under arbitrary wireless communication faults. We propose a formal procedure to transform the design pattern hybrid automata into specific wireless CPS designs. This procedure can effectively isolate physical world parameters from affecting the PTE safety of the resultant specific designs. We conduct two wireless CPS case studies, one on medicine and the other on control, to show that the resulted system is safe against communication failures.

565,0,"Autonomous network repairing of a home security system using modular self-reconfigurable robots Traditional wheeled robots cannot easily adapt to complex home environments with stairs and doorsills. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel wireless sensor network based home security system with a modular self-reconfigurable robot (Transmote) as the mobile node. The security system is composed of some static monitoring nodes, a Transmote, and a home server. Static nodes with pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor and digital camera are mounted on doorframes and windows to detect intruders and send intrusion alarm messages to the home server. Transmote with PIR sensor and camera can patrol in the house for security surveillance. Transmote also can provide network repairing service when some static router nodes fail. Transmote modules and static monitoring nodes are controlled by two different wireless sensor networks. The remote house owner can get the alarm messages through Internet. Transmote can transform into I-shaped or O-shaped configuration according to different locomotion requirements. A prototype system has been implemented and some performance tests have been done. Experimental results show that the I-shaped Transmote can pass through an 8.8 cm high and 10 cm wide channel. The velocity of the I-shaped Transmote is up to 3 m/min and the maximum velocity of O-shaped Transmote is 9.3 m/min.

567,0,"Determination of Sit-to-Stand Transfer Duration Using Bed and Floor Pressure Sequences The duration of a sit-to-stand (SiSt) transfer is a representative measure of a person's status of physical mobility. This paper measured the duration unobtrusively and automatically using a pressure sensor array under a bed mattress and a floor plate beside the bed. Pressure sequences were extracted from frames of sensor data measuring bed and floor pressure over time. The start time was determined by an algorithm based on the motion of the center of pressure (COP) on the mattress toward the front edge of the bed. The end time was determined by modeling the foot pressure exerted on the floor in the wavelet domain as the step response of a third-order transfer function. As expected, young and old healthy adults generated shorter SiSt durations of around 2.31 and 2.88 s, respectively, whereas post-hip fracture and post-stroke adults produced longer SiSt durations of around 3.32 and 5.00 s.

An episode is a set of sequential user activities that periodically occur in smart homes. The extracted episodes are processed and arranged in a finite-order Markov model. A method based on prediction by partial matching (PPM) algorithm is applied to predict the next activity from the previous history.

IEEE 1394 is the best way for the real-time transmission of high bandwidth audio/video (A/V) content inside a home, and Ethernet provides a connection to anywhere, not only in homes, but also outside by using wired or wireless mobile solutions, however, because of differences between the two stream solutions (DV-IEEE 1394 and MPEG-4-Ethernet), an appropriate device or function is needed between the two parts.

571,0,"Autonomous Demand Response Using Stochastic Differential Games Demand response (DR) programs are implemented to encourage consumers to reduce their electricity demand when needed, e.g., at peak-load hours, by adjusting their controllable load. In this paper, our focus is on controllable load types that are associated with dynamic systems and can be modeled using differential equations. Examples of such load types include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; water heating; and refrigeration. In this regard, we propose a new DR model based on a two-level differential game framework. At the beginning of each DR interval, the price is decided by the upper level (aggregator, utility, or market) given the total demand of users in the lower level. At the lower level, for each player (residential or commercial buildings that are equipped with automated load control systems and local renewable generators), given the price from the upper level, the electricity usage of air conditioning unit, and the battery storage charging/discharging schedules, are controlled in order to minimize the user's total electricity cost. The optimal user strategies are derived using the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also show that the proposed game can converge to a feedback Nash equilibrium. Based on the effect of real-time pricing on users' daily demand profile, the simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed game and show how we can optimize consumers' electricity cost in the presence of time-varying prices. differential equations, differential games, load flow control, stochastic games, feedback Nash equilibrium, stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, battery storage, air conditioning unit, renewable generators, automated load control systems, differential equations, controllable load, electricity demand, demand response programs, stochastic differential games, Buildings, Games, Electricity, Stochastic processes, Batteries, Mathematical model, Optimization, Autonomous demand response, real-time pricing, smart building, stochastic differential game, Autonomous demand response, real-time pricing, smart building, stochastic differential game",autonomous demand response using stochastic differential games demand response dr programs are implemented to encourage consumers to reduce their electricity demand when needed e g at peak load hours by adjusting their controllable load in this paper our focus is on controllable load types that are associated with dynamic systems and can be modeled using differential equations examples of such load types include heating ventilation and air conditioning water heating and refrigeration in this regard we propose a new dr model based on a two level differential game framework at the beginning of each dr interval the price is decided by the upper level aggregator utility or market given the total demand of users in the lower level at the lower level for each player residential or commercial buildings that are equipped with automated load control systems and local renewable generators given the price from the upper level the electricity usage of air conditioning unit and the battery storage charging discharging schedules are controlled in order to minimize the user s total electricity cost the optimal user strategies are derived using the stochastic hamilton jacobi bellman equations we also show that the proposed game can converge to a feedback nash equilibrium based on the effect of real time pricing on users daily demand profile the simulation results demonstrate the properties of the proposed game and show how we can optimize consumers electricity cost in the presence of time varying prices differential equations differential games load flow control stochastic games feedback nash equilibrium stochastic hamilton jacobi bellman equations battery storage air conditioning unit renewable generators automated load control systems differential equations controllable load electricity demand demand response programs stochastic differential games buildings games electricity stochastic processes batteries mathematical model optimization autonomous demand response real time pricing smart building stochastic differential game autonomous demand response real time pricing smart building stochastic differential game,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
572,0,"Information-Theoretic Security in Stochastic Control Systems Infrastructural systems such as the electricity grid, healthcare, and transportation networks today rely increasingly on the joint functioning of networked information systems and physical components, in short, on cyber-physical architectures. Despite tremendous advances in cryptography, physical-layer security and authentication, information attacks, both passive such as eavesdropping, and active such as unauthorized data injection, continue to thwart the reliable functioning of networked systems. In systems with joint cyber-physical functionality, the ability of an adversary to monitor transmitted information or introduce false information can lead to sensitive user data being leaked or result in critical damages to the underlying physical system. This paper investigates two broad challenges in information security in cyber-physical systems (CPSs): preventing retrieval of internal physical system information through monitored external cyber flows, and limiting the modification of physical system functioning through compromised cyber flows. A rigorous analytical framework grounded on information-theoretic security is developed to study these challenges in a general stochastic control system abstraction-a theoretical building block for CPSs-with the objectives of quantifying the fundamental tradeoffs between information security and physical system performance, and through the process, designing provably secure controller policies. Recent results are presented that establish the theoretical basis for the framework, in addition to practical applications in timing analysis of anonymous systems, and demand response systems in a smart electricity grid. control engineering computing, power engineering computing, power system control, power system security, security of data, smart power grids, stochastic processes, stochastic systems, information-theoretic security, stochastic control system, cyber-physical architecture, cyber-physical system, CPS, networked controller, controller policy security, anonymous system timing analysis, demand response system, smart electricity grid, Control systems, Stochastic processes, Information security, Monitoring, Smart meters, Communication system security, Security, Telecommunication services, Physical layer, Cyber-physical systems, entropy, information security, stochastic control",information theoretic security in stochastic control systems infrastructural systems such as the electricity grid healthcare and transportation networks today rely increasingly on the joint functioning of networked information systems and physical components in short on cyber physical architectures despite tremendous advances in cryptography physical layer security and authentication information attacks both passive such as eavesdropping and active such as unauthorized data injection continue to thwart the reliable functioning of networked systems in systems with joint cyber physical functionality the ability of an adversary to monitor transmitted information or introduce false information can lead to sensitive user data being leaked or result in critical damages to the underlying physical system this paper investigates two broad challenges in information security in cyber physical systems cpss preventing retrieval of internal physical system information through monitored external cyber flows and limiting the modification of physical system functioning through compromised cyber flows a rigorous analytical framework grounded on information theoretic security is developed to study these challenges in a general stochastic control system abstraction a theoretical building block for cpss with the objectives of quantifying the fundamental tradeoffs between information security and physical system performance and through the process designing provably secure controller policies recent results are presented that establish the theoretical basis for the framework in addition to practical applications in timing analysis of anonymous systems and demand response systems in a smart electricity grid control engineering computing power engineering computing power system control power system security security of data smart power grids stochastic processes stochastic systems information theoretic security stochastic control system cyber physical architecture cyber physical system cps networked controller controller policy security anonymous system timing analysis demand response system smart electricity grid control systems stochastic processes information security monitoring smart meters communication system security security telecommunication services physical layer cyber physical systems entropy information security stochastic control,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

The proposed framework combines control-theoretic methods, information security notions and computational models to characterize tradeoffs among different design and operation objectives. We quantify the intricate relation among control performance, system security and platform schedulability through a minimal set of interface variables. We argue that security mechanisms and control algorithms need to be codesigned and comanaged with the embedded platform, so as to avoid the design of algorithms that are too expensive to implement on the embedded platform, or significantly impede design objectives such as performance and timing robustness. control engineering computing, embedded systems, security of data, reliable resource constrained cyber-physical systems, control theoretic method, information security notion, computational model, interface variables, security mechanism, control algorithms, Control systems, Encryption, Sensors, Algorithm design and analysis, Real-time systems, Automotive systems, control theory, cyber-physical system, embedded systems, security",design and operation of secure cyber physical systems this letter proposes a holistic framework for the design and operation of secure and reliable resource constrained cyber physical systems the proposed framework combines control theoretic methods information security notions and computational models to characterize tradeoffs among different design and operation objectives we quantify the intricate relation among control performance system security and platform schedulability through a minimal set of interface variables we argue that security mechanisms and control algorithms need to be codesigned and comanaged with the embedded platform so as to avoid the design of algorithms that are too expensive to implement on the embedded platform or significantly impede design objectives such as performance and timing robustness control engineering computing embedded systems security of data reliable resource constrained cyber physical systems control theoretic method information security notion computational model interface variables security mechanism control algorithms control systems encryption sensors algorithm design and analysis real time systems automotive systems control theory cyber physical system embedded systems security,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

575,0,"Depth video-based human activity recognition system using translation and scaling invariant features for life logging at smart home Video-based human activity recognition systems have potential contributions to various applications such as smart homes and healthcare services. In this work, we present a novel depth video-based translation and scaling invariant human activity recognition (HAR) system utilizing R transformation of depth silhouettes. To perform HAR in indoor settings, an invariant HAR method is critical to freely perform activities anywhere in a camera view without translation and scaling problems of human body silhouettes. We obtain such invariant features via R transformation on depth silhouettes. Furthermore, in R transforming depth silhouettes, shape information of human body reflected in depth values is encoded into the features. In R transformation, 2D feature maps are computed first through Radon transform of each depth silhouette followed by computing 1D feature profile through R transform to get the translation and scaling invariant features. Then, we apply Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to make the features more prominent, compact and robust. Finally, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to train and recognize different human activities. Our proposed system shows superior recognition rate over the conventional approaches, reaching up to the mean recognition rate of 93.16% for six typical human activities whereas the conventional PC and IC-based depth silhouettes achieved only 74.83% and 86.33% ,while binary silhouettes-based R transformation approach achieved 67.08% respectively.

583,0,"Cognitive Radio Based State Estimation in Cyber-Physical Systems We investigate the state estimation problem in cyber-physical systems (CPS) where the dynamical physical process is measured by a wireless sensor and the measurements are transmitted to a remote state estimator. It has been shown that the estimation performance strongly depends on the wireless communication quality. To enhance the estimation performance, we apply the cognitive radio technique to the system and propose a CHAnnel seNsing and switChing mEchanism (CHANCE) to explore opportunistic accessibility of multiple channels. We consider two types of wireless channels, i.e., one unlicensed channel which can be accessed freely and several licensed channels which have been pre-assigned to primary users. For the single-licensed-channel case, we develop a necessary condition for the estimation stability based on the physical process dynamics, channel quality and the channel sensing accuracy. This condition becomes also sufficient under certain conditions. We also derive the conditions under which the estimation performance is guaranteed to be improved by CHANCE. The above results are then extended to multi-licensed-channel cases. Simulations based on a particular linear system show that, the long-run mean estimation error covariance with CHANCE is at least 63% less than that without CHANCE. It is also shown that CHANCE outperforms the existing RANDOM mechanism in terms of estimation performance. cognitive radio, covariance analysis, state estimation, wireless channels, cognitive radio-based state estimation, cyber-physical systems, dynamical physical process, wireless sensor, remote state estimator, wireless communication quality, estimation performance, cognitive radio technique, channel sensing-switching mechanism, multiple-channel opportunistic accessibility, CHANCE, wireless channels, unlicensed channel, primary users, estimation stability, single-licensed-channel, physical process dynamics, channel quality, channel sensing accuracy, multilicensed-channel, linear system, long-run mean estimation error covariance, RANDOM mechanism, Sensors, Packet loss, Stability analysis, State estimation, Channel estimation, Cognitive radio, cyber physical system, state estimation, stability condition, performance bounds",cognitive radio based state estimation in cyber physical systems we investigate the state estimation problem in cyber physical systems cps where the dynamical physical process is measured by a wireless sensor and the measurements are transmitted to a remote state estimator it has been shown that the estimation performance strongly depends on the wireless communication quality to enhance the estimation performance we apply the cognitive radio technique to the system and propose a channel sensing and switching mechanism chance to explore opportunistic accessibility of multiple channels we consider two types of wireless channels i e one unlicensed channel which can be accessed freely and several licensed channels which have been pre assigned to primary users for the single licensed channel case we develop a necessary condition for the estimation stability based on the physical process dynamics channel quality and the channel sensing accuracy this condition becomes also sufficient under certain conditions we also derive the conditions under which the estimation performance is guaranteed to be improved by chance the above results are then extended to multi licensed channel cases simulations based on a particular linear system show that the long run mean estimation error covariance with chance is at least 63 less than that without chance it is also shown that chance outperforms the existing random mechanism in terms of estimation performance cognitive radio covariance analysis state estimation wireless channels cognitive radio based state estimation cyber physical systems dynamical physical process wireless sensor remote state estimator wireless communication quality estimation performance cognitive radio technique channel sensing switching mechanism multiple channel opportunistic accessibility chance wireless channels unlicensed channel primary users estimation stability single licensed channel physical process dynamics channel quality channel sensing accuracy multilicensed channel linear system long run mean estimation error covariance random mechanism sensors packet loss stability analysis state estimation channel estimation cognitive radio cyber physical system state estimation stability condition performance bounds,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

In this paper, we propose a novel EMS formulation for DR problems in these sectors. Specifically, we formulate a fully automated EMS's rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and argue that this RL problem can be approximately solved by decomposing it over device clusters. Compared with existing formulations, our new formulation does not require explicitly modeling the user's dissatisfaction on job rescheduling, enables the EMS to self-initiate jobs, allows the user to initiate more flexible requests, and has a computational complexity linear in the number of device clusters.

586,0,"Security Games for Risk Minimization in Automatic Generation Control The power grid is a critical infrastructure that must be protected against potential threats. While modern technologies at the center of the ongoing smart grid evolution increase its operational efficiency, they also make it more susceptible to malicious attacks such as false data injection to electronic monitoring systems. This paper presents a game-theoretic approach to smart grid security by combining quantitative risk management techniques with decision making on protective measures. The consequences of data injection attacks are quantified using a risk assessment process where the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure provides an estimate of the defender's loss due to load shed in simulated scenarios. The calculated risks are then incorporated into a stochastic security game model as input parameters. The decisions on defensive measures are obtained by solving the game using dynamic programming techniques which take into account resource constraints. Thus, the formulated security game provides an analytical framework for choosing the best response strategies against attackers and minimizing potential risks. The theoretical results obtained are demonstrated through numerical examples. Simulation results show that different risk measures lead to different defense strategies, but the CVaR measure prioritizes high-loss tail events. decision making, load shedding, power generation control, power system protection, smart power grids, stochastic games, security games, risk minimization, automatic generation control, power grid, smart grid evolution, operational efficiency, malicious attacks, false data injection, electronic monitoring systems, game-theoretic approach, smart grid security, quantitative risk management techniques, decision making, protective measures, data injection attacks, risk assessment process, conditional value-at-risk measure, load shed, stochastic security game model, defensive measures, dynamic programming techniques, resource constraints, response strategies, high-loss tail events, Games, Security, Automatic generation control, Smart grids, Frequency control, Risk management, Game theory, Automatic generation control, cyber-physical system security, security games, smart grid",security games for risk minimization in automatic generation control the power grid is a critical infrastructure that must be protected against potential threats while modern technologies at the center of the ongoing smart grid evolution increase its operational efficiency they also make it more susceptible to malicious attacks such as false data injection to electronic monitoring systems this paper presents a game theoretic approach to smart grid security by combining quantitative risk management techniques with decision making on protective measures the consequences of data injection attacks are quantified using a risk assessment process where the well known conditional value at risk cvar measure provides an estimate of the defender s loss due to load shed in simulated scenarios the calculated risks are then incorporated into a stochastic security game model as input parameters the decisions on defensive measures are obtained by solving the game using dynamic programming techniques which take into account resource constraints thus the formulated security game provides an analytical framework for choosing the best response strategies against attackers and minimizing potential risks the theoretical results obtained are demonstrated through numerical examples simulation results show that different risk measures lead to different defense strategies but the cvar measure prioritizes high loss tail events decision making load shedding power generation control power system protection smart power grids stochastic games security games risk minimization automatic generation control power grid smart grid evolution operational efficiency malicious attacks false data injection electronic monitoring systems game theoretic approach smart grid security quantitative risk management techniques decision making protective measures data injection attacks risk assessment process conditional value at risk measure load shed stochastic security game model defensive measures dynamic programming techniques resource constraints response strategies high loss tail events games security automatic generation control smart grids frequency control risk management game theory automatic generation control cyber physical system security security games smart grid,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

We study the safety of a medical device system for the physiologic closed-loop control of drug infusion. The main contribution of the paper is the verification approach for the safety properties of closed-loop medical device systems. We demonstrate, using a case study, that the approach can be applied to a system of clinical importance. Our method combines simulation-based analysis of a detailed model of the system that contains continuous patient dynamics with model checking of a more abstract timed automata model. We show that the relationship between the two models preserves the crucial aspect of the timing behavior that ensures the conservativeness of the safety analysis.

596,0,"Self-Learning Load Characteristic Models for Smart Appliances It is generally accepted that if dynamic electricity pricing tariffs were to be introduced, their effectiveness in controlling domestic loads will be curtailed if consumers were relied on to respond in their own interests. The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage.

As the demand on Internet services and cloud computing has kept increasing in recent years, the power usage associated with IDC operations has been uprising significantly. The cyber and physical aspects of IDCs interact with each other, and bring unprecedented challenges in power management. While most existing research focuses on reducing power consumptions of IDCs at one specific location, the problem of reducing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the present multielectricity-market environment, where the price of electricity may exhibit temporal and spatial diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS; i.e., service level objectives) such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of critical importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost geared to QoS constraint as well as the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price under multiregional electricity markets. We jointly consider both the cyber and physical management capabilities of IDCs, and exploit both the center-level load balancing and the server-level power control in a unified scheme. We model the problem as a constrained mixed integer programming based on generalized benders decomposition (GBD) technique.

601,0,"Activity Discovery and Activity Recognition: A New Partnership Activity recognition has received increasing attention from the machine learning community. Of particular interest is the ability to recognize activities in real time from streaming data, but this presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional offline approaches. Among these challenges is handling the large amount of data that does not belong to a predefined class. In this paper, we describe a method by which activity discovery can be used to identify behavioral patterns in observational data. Discovering patterns in the data that does not belong to a predefined class aids in understanding this data and segmenting it into learnable classes. We demonstrate that activity discovery not only sheds light on behavioral patterns, but it can also boost the performance of recognition algorithms.

602,0,"Simultaneous mobile sink allocation in home environments with applications in mobile consumer robotics This paper presents a novel mobile sink area allocation scheme for consumer based mobile robotic devices with a proven application to robotic vacuum cleaners. In the home or office environment, rooms are physically separated by walls and an automated robotic cleaner cannot make a decision about which room to move to and perform the cleaning task. Likewise, state of the art cleaning robots do not move to other rooms without direct human interference. In a smart home monitoring system, sensor nodes may be deployed to monitor each separate room. In this work, a quad tree based data gathering scheme is proposed whereby the mobile sink physically moves through every room and logically links all separated sub-networks together. The proposed scheme sequentially collects data from the monitoring environment and transmits the information back to a base station. According to the sensor nodes information, the base station can command a cleaning robot to move to a specific location in the home environment. The quad tree based data gathering scheme minimizes the data gathering tour length and time through the efficient allocation of data gathering areas. A calculated shortest path data gathering tour can efficiently be allocated to the robotic cleaner to complete the cleaning task within a minimum time period. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively allocate and control the cleaning area to the robot vacuum cleaner without any direct interference from the consumer. The performance of the proposed scheme is then validated with a set of practical sequential data gathering tours in a typical office/home environment. data acquisition, home automation, mobile robots, quadtrees, sensor placement, service robots, mobile sink area allocation scheme, consumer based mobile robotic device, robotic vacuum cleaner, smart home monitoring system, sensor node deployment, quad tree based data gathering scheme, base station, cleaning area control, Mobile communication, Robot sensing systems, Resource management, Smart homes, Monitoring, Mobile sinks, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Robotic Vacuum Cleaner, Clearing Area Assessment",simultaneous mobile sink allocation in home environments with applications in mobile consumer robotics this paper presents a novel mobile sink area allocation scheme for consumer based mobile robotic devices with a proven application to robotic vacuum cleaners in the home or office environment rooms are physically separated by walls and an automated robotic cleaner cannot make a decision about which room to move to and perform the cleaning task likewise state of the art cleaning robots do not move to other rooms without direct human interference in a smart home monitoring system sensor nodes may be deployed to monitor each separate room in this work a quad tree based data gathering scheme is proposed whereby the mobile sink physically moves through every room and logically links all separated sub networks together the proposed scheme sequentially collects data from the monitoring environment and transmits the information back to a base station according to the sensor nodes information the base station can command a cleaning robot to move to a specific location in the home environment the quad tree based data gathering scheme minimizes the data gathering tour length and time through the efficient allocation of data gathering areas a calculated shortest path data gathering tour can efficiently be allocated to the robotic cleaner to complete the cleaning task within a minimum time period simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively allocate and control the cleaning area to the robot vacuum cleaner without any direct interference from the consumer the performance of the proposed scheme is then validated with a set of practical sequential data gathering tours in a typical office home environment data acquisition home automation mobile robots quadtrees sensor placement service robots mobile sink area allocation scheme consumer based mobile robotic device robotic vacuum cleaner smart home monitoring system sensor node deployment quad tree based data gathering scheme base station cleaning area control mobile communication robot sensing systems resource management smart homes monitoring mobile sinks wireless sensor network wsn robotic vacuum cleaner clearing area assessment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Efficient demand-supply balance and reducing electricity expenses and carbon emissions will be the immediate benefits of these applications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an in-home energy management (iHEM) application. The performance of iHEM is compared with an optimization-based residential energy management (OREM) scheme whose objective is to minimize the energy expenses of the consumers. We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM. On the other hand, iHEM application is more flexible as it allows communication between the controller and the consumer utilizing the wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN). We evaluate the performance of iHEM under the presence of local energy generation capability, prioritized appliances, and for real-time pricing. We show that iHEM reduces the expenses of the consumers for each case.

As a result, the resource management of the OSGi platform has become a critical issue. This paper focuses on how to enhance the efficiency of resource utilization in terms of the service activation and deactivation. We propose the service activator (SA), which is designed as an OSGi bundle, to on-demand activate and deactivate OSGi services, so that the resources required by services can be allocated and deallocated automatically. This involves a graph-based representation of services dependencies and two new algorithms. We have implemented the SA on an OSGi implementation (Knopflerfish); a home network prototype with a home surveillance scenario is presented to demonstrate the feasibility.

Attack techniques proposed in the literature often require detailed knowledge of system parameters. Such information is difficult to acquire in practice. The subspace methods presented in this paper, on the other hand, learn the system operating subspace from measurements and launch attacks accordingly. Conditions for the existence of an unobservable subspace attack are obtained under the full and partial measurement models. Using the estimated system subspace, two attack strategies are presented. The first strategy aims to affect the system state directly by hiding the attack vector in the system subspace.

Unfortunately, the energy demands of newer ambient intelligence and collaborative technologies on mobile devices have greatly overwhelmed modern energy storage abilities.

These techniques, which include variants of linear discriminant analysis, linear logistic regression, non-linear logistic regression with neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines are explored and compared on synthetic and user traces from real-world usage studies. The experimental results show that up to 90% successful prediction is possible with neural networks and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, improving upon prediction strategies in prior work by approximately 50%.

615,0,"Smart Homecare Surveillance System: Behavior Identification Based on State-Transition Support Vector Machines and Sound Directivity Pattern Analysis This study presents a smart homecare surveillance system, which utilizes sound-steered cameras to identify behavior of interest. First of all, to detect multiple source locations, a new direction-of-arrival (DOA) algorithm is proposed by introducing cascaded frequency filters, which can quickly calculate directions without creating much complexity. This method can also locate and separate different signals at the same time. Second, after the camera points in the direction of the estimated angle, the proposed state-transition support vector machine is used to provide favorable discriminability for human behavior identification. A new Markov random field (MRF) function based on the localized contour sequence (LCS) is also presented while the system computes transition probabilities between states. Such LCS-based MRF functions can effectively smooth transitions and enhance recognition. The experimental results show that the average error of DOA decreases to around 7$ ^\circ$, which is better than those of the baselines. Also, our proposed behavior identification system can reach an 88.3% accuracy rate.

617,0,"Local Dynamic Stability Assessment of Motion Impaired Elderly Using Electronic Textile Pants A clear association has been demonstrated between gait stability and falls in the elderly. Integration of wearable computing and human dynamic stability measures into home automation systems may help differentiate fall-prone individuals in a residential environment. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the capability of a pair of electronic textile (e-textile) pants system to assess local dynamic stability and to differentiate motion-impaired elderly from their healthy counterparts. A pair of e-textile pants comprised of numerous e-TAGs at locations corresponding to lower extremity joints was developed to collect acceleration, angular velocity and piezoelectric data. Four motion-impaired elderly together with nine healthy individuals (both young and old) participated in treadmill walking with a motion capture system simultaneously collecting kinematic data. Local dynamic stability, characterized by maximum Lyapunov exponent, was computed based on vertical acceleration and angular velocity at lower extremity joints for the measurements from both e-textile and motion capture systems. Results indicated that the motion-impaired elderly had significantly higher maximum Lyapunov exponents (computed from vertical acceleration data) than healthy individuals at the right ankle and hip joints. In addition, maximum Lyapunov exponents assessed by the motion capture system were found to be significantly higher than those assessed by the e-textile system. Despite the difference between these measurement techniques, attaching accelerometers at the ankle and hip joints was shown to be an effective sensor configuration.

Recent studies dealing with home network systems aggregate the sensor data and manage various devices for reasoning the adaptive services. However, home network systems, especially intelligent devices, are difficult to implement due to the high setup cost and the problems with interconnection among other devices in a home domain. Therefore, we consider the intelligent implementation of light switch present in whole spaces. We propose a LED Smart switch with light-weight middleware which provides location-aware service and pattern-based service prediction. The proposed switch with an embedded sensor manages active and passive events according to the sensor data analysis and the service reasoning. Furthermore, the LED smart switch locates the user and interconnects among other switches over a network connection.

620,0,"Probabilistic Novelty Detection for Acoustic Surveillance Under Real-World Conditions Novelty detection in the machine learning context refers to identifying unknown/novel data, i.e., data which vary greatly from the ones that the system was trained with. This paper explores this technique as applied to acoustic surveillance of abnormal situations. The ultimate goal of the system is to help an authorized person towards taking the appropriate actions for preventing life/property loss. A wide variety of acoustic parameters is employed towards forming a multidomain feature vector, which captures diverse characteristics of the audio signals. Subsequently the feature coefficients are fed to three probabilistic novelty detection methodologies. Their performance is computed using two measures which take into account misdetections and false alarms. Out dataset was recorded under real-world conditions including three different locations where various types of normal and abnormal sound events were captured.

623,0,"Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging: A Customer's Perspective Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered to be a promising solution for current gas shortage and emission problems. To maximize the benefits of using EVs, regulated and optimized charging control needs to be provided by load aggregators for connected vehicles. An EV charging network is a typical cyber-physical system, which includes a power grid and a large number of EVs and aggregators that collect information and control the charging procedure. In this paper, we studied EV charging scheduling problems from a customer's perspective by jointly considering the aggregator's revenue and customers' demands and costs. We considered two charging scenarios: static and dynamic. In the static charging scenario, customers' charging demands are provided to the aggregator in advance; however, in the dynamic charging scenario, an EV may come and leave at any time, which is not known to the aggregator in advance. We present linear programming (LP)-based optimal schemes for the static problems and effective heuristic algorithms for the dynamic problems. The dynamic scenario is more realistic; however, the solutions to the static problems can be used to show potential revenue gains and cost savings that can be brought by regulated charging and, thus, can serve as a benchmark for performance evaluation. It has been shown by extensive simulation results based on real electricity price and load data that significant revenue gains and cost savings can be achieved by optimal charging scheduling compared with an unregulated baseline approach, and moreover, the proposed dynamic charging scheduling schemes provide close-to-optimal solutions. demand side management, electric vehicles, linear programming, power grids, electric vehicle charging optimization, EV charging network, optimized charging control, regulated charging control, load aggregator, cyber-physical system, EV charging scheduling problem, static charging scenario, customer charging demand, dynamic charging scenario, linear programming-based optimal scheme, LP-based optimal scheme, heuristic algorithm, electricity price, load data, power grid, System-on-chip, Vehicles, Heuristic algorithms, Dynamic scheduling, Batteries, Electricity, Vehicle dynamics, Charging regulation, electric vehicle (EV), optimization, smart grid",optimizing electric vehicle charging a customer s perspective electric vehicles evs are considered to be a promising solution for current gas shortage and emission problems to maximize the benefits of using evs regulated and optimized charging control needs to be provided by load aggregators for connected vehicles an ev charging network is a typical cyber physical system which includes a power grid and a large number of evs and aggregators that collect information and control the charging procedure in this paper we studied ev charging scheduling problems from a customer s perspective by jointly considering the aggregator s revenue and customers demands and costs we considered two charging scenarios static and dynamic in the static charging scenario customers charging demands are provided to the aggregator in advance however in the dynamic charging scenario an ev may come and leave at any time which is not known to the aggregator in advance we present linear programming lp based optimal schemes for the static problems and effective heuristic algorithms for the dynamic problems the dynamic scenario is more realistic however the solutions to the static problems can be used to show potential revenue gains and cost savings that can be brought by regulated charging and thus can serve as a benchmark for performance evaluation it has been shown by extensive simulation results based on real electricity price and load data that significant revenue gains and cost savings can be achieved by optimal charging scheduling compared with an unregulated baseline approach and moreover the proposed dynamic charging scheduling schemes provide close to optimal solutions demand side management electric vehicles linear programming power grids electric vehicle charging optimization ev charging network optimized charging control regulated charging control load aggregator cyber physical system ev charging scheduling problem static charging scenario customer charging demand dynamic charging scenario linear programming based optimal scheme lp based optimal scheme heuristic algorithm electricity price load data power grid system on chip vehicles heuristic algorithms dynamic scheduling batteries electricity vehicle dynamics charging regulation electric vehicle ev optimization smart grid,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

625,0,"Distributed Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Networked Industrial Sensing Systems Reliable real-time sensing plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and safety of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs) such as wireless sensor and actuator networks. For many reasons, such as harsh industrial environments, fault-prone sensors, or malicious attacks, sensor readings may be abnormal or faulty. This could lead to serious system performance degradation or even catastrophic failure. Current anomaly detection approaches are either centralized and complicated or restricted due to strict assumptions, which are not suitable for practical large-scale networked industrial sensing systems (NISSs), where sensing devices are connected via digital communications, such as wireless sensor networks or smart grid systems. In this paper, we introduce a fully distributed general anomaly detection (GAD) scheme, which uses graph theory and exploits spatiotemporal correlations of physical processes to carry out real-time anomaly detection for general large-scale NISSs.

626,0,"Game-Theoretic Modeling of Joint Topology Control and Power Scheduling for Wireless Heterogeneous Sensor Networks Wireless Heterogeneous Sensor Network (WHSN) facilitates ubiquitous information acquisition for Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems. It is of great importance of power management and topology control for WHSN to achieve desirable network performances, such as clustering properties, connectivity and power efficiency. This paper proposes a game theoretic model of topology control to analyze the decentralized interactions among heterogeneous sensors. We study the utility function for nodes to achieve desirable frame success rate and node degree, while minimizing the power consumption. Specifically, we propose a static complete-information game formulation for power scheduling and then prove the existence of the Nash equilibrium with simultaneous move. Because the heterogeneous sensors typically react to neighboring environment based on local information and the states of sensors are evolving over time, the power-scheduling problem in WHSN is further formulated into a more realistic incomplete-information dynamic game model with sequential move. We then analyze the separating equilibrium, one of the perfect Bayesian equilibriums resulted from the dynamic game, with the sensors revealing their operational states from their actions. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of separating equilibrium are derived for the dynamic Bayesian game, which provide theoretical basis to the proposed power scheduling algorithms, NEPow and BEPow. The primary contributions of this paper include applying game theory to analyze the distributed decision-making process of individual sensor nodes and to analyze the desirable utilities of heterogeneous sensor nodes.

Although the future of smart homes is promising, many technical challenges must be addressed to achieve convenience and security.

We present a set of intuitive access control policies and suggest four access control settings based on our in-person interview results. Furthermore, we propose the automated Clairvoyant access right assignment (CARA) mechanism that utilizes home owners' social relationship to automatically deduce to which class a visitor belongs. The combination of CARA and the suggested mapping provides a promising first step for home policy assignment such that non-expert home owners can let visitors use their home network with confidence.

634,0,"A Survey of Energy Efficiency in Buildings and Microgrids using Networking Technologies Intelligent buildings and microgrids are important parts of the future smart grid. The adoption and development process of the intelligent buildings has been slow. There are multiple technical and non-technical reasons. However, two recent trends have accelerated the research and application of the technologies related to this area. First, skyrocketing energy price and the global need for reducing fossil oil consumption for environmental sustainability combined with the fact that buildings are a significant source of energy consumption, making buildings intelligent and energy efficient will have huge impacts on the total CO2 emission and hence global sustainability. Second, rapid popularity and maturation of mobile smart phone technology and Internet technologies like cloud computing enable smart phone holders to be aware of their energy consumption and participate in controlling and running their buildings with seamless Internet connections. Cloud computing enables active interactions between the consumer-side (buildings) and the provider-side (smart grids). Hence, combining energy efficiency and networking perspectives, in this paper, we investigate the key research topics through a broad survey on the latest developments in intelligent buildings and our vision of microgrids formed by such buildings. Our aim is to draw an overall picture of the current research and potential future applications.

635,0,"Brain Computer Interface-Based Smart Living Environmental Auto-Adjustment Control System in UPnP Home Networking A brain computer interface-based smart living environmental auto-adjustment control system (BSLEACS) is proposed in this paper. Recently, many environmental control systems have been proposed to improve human quality of life. However, little research has focused on environmental control directly using the human physiological state. Based on the advantage of our technique on brain computer interface (BCI), we integrated the BCI technique with universal plug and play (UPnP) home networking for smart house applications. BSLEACS mainly consists of a wireless physiological signal acquisition module, an embedded signal processing module, a simple control protocol/power line communication environmental controller, and a host system. Here, the physiological signal acquisition module and embedded signal processing module were designed for long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and backend analysis, respectively. The advantages of low power consumption and small volume of the above modules are suitable for smart house applications in daily life. Moreover, different from other BCI systems, the property of using only a single EEG channel to monitor cognitive state also makes BSLEACS become more practicable. BSLEACS has been verified in a practical demo room, and the environmental adjustment can be automatically controlled by the change of the user's cognitive state. BSLEACS provides a novel system prototype for environmental control, and can be simply extended and integrated with the UPnP home networking for other applications. brain-computer interfaces, carrier transmission on power lines, electroencephalography, environmental engineering, home automation, home networks, low-power electronics, protocols, signal detection, signal processing, brain computer interface-based smart living environmental auto-adjustment control system, UPnP home networking, BSLEACS, universal plug and play home networking, smart house applications, wireless physiological signal acquisition module, embedded signal processing module, control protocol, power line communication environmental controller, long-term electroencephalogram monitoring, backend analysis, low power consumption, EEG channel, user cognitive state monitoring, human physiological state, Electroencephalography, Wireless communication, Control systems, Signal processing, Rhythm, Communication system security, Physiology, Brain computer interface (BCI), electroencephalogram (EEG), power line communication, simple control protocol, smart house, universal plug and play (UPnP), Brain computer interface (BCI), electroencephalogram (EEG), power line communication, simple control protocol, smart house, universal plug and play (UPnP)",brain computer interface based smart living environmental auto adjustment control system in upnp home networking a brain computer interface based smart living environmental auto adjustment control system bsleacs is proposed in this paper recently many environmental control systems have been proposed to improve human quality of life however little research has focused on environmental control directly using the human physiological state based on the advantage of our technique on brain computer interface bci we integrated the bci technique with universal plug and play upnp home networking for smart house applications bsleacs mainly consists of a wireless physiological signal acquisition module an embedded signal processing module a simple control protocol power line communication environmental controller and a host system here the physiological signal acquisition module and embedded signal processing module were designed for long term electroencephalogram eeg monitoring and backend analysis respectively the advantages of low power consumption and small volume of the above modules are suitable for smart house applications in daily life moreover different from other bci systems the property of using only a single eeg channel to monitor cognitive state also makes bsleacs become more practicable bsleacs has been verified in a practical demo room and the environmental adjustment can be automatically controlled by the change of the user s cognitive state bsleacs provides a novel system prototype for environmental control and can be simply extended and integrated with the upnp home networking for other applications brain computer interfaces carrier transmission on power lines electroencephalography environmental engineering home automation home networks low power electronics protocols signal detection signal processing brain computer interface based smart living environmental auto adjustment control system upnp home networking bsleacs universal plug and play home networking smart house applications wireless physiological signal acquisition module embedded signal processing module control protocol power line communication environmental controller long term electroencephalogram monitoring backend analysis low power consumption eeg channel user cognitive state monitoring human physiological state electroencephalography wireless communication control systems signal processing rhythm communication system security physiology brain computer interface bci electroencephalogram eeg power line communication simple control protocol smart house universal plug and play upnp brain computer interface bci electroencephalogram eeg power line communication simple control protocol smart house universal plug and play upnp,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

638,0,"Smart Signage: A Draggable Cyber-Physical Broadcast/Multicast Media System Digital displays, as the replacement of traditional static signs, have gained increasing popularity for out-of-home advertising. Latest advancements in smartphone, wireless communication, and digital display technologies make it possible to design new interactive signage systems linking the digital content with the physical digital displays. Although recent studies have demonstrated the trend of cyber-physical interaction, they are not generally scalable for multiple users, and none of them support interaction with multiple displays in one location. Smart Signage, a ``draggable'' cyber-physical broadcast/multicast (B/M) media system is proposed in this paper.

641,0,"A Holistic Approach to Service Delivery in Driver-in-the-Loop Vehicular CPS Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS) provide human drivers with various services related to road safety, and on-road infotainments. Since a service (message) delivery includes service transmission, service display and driver processing, many challenges arise due to limited network resources, possible pre-emption and contention between services for the display and non-negligible driver processing delay. In this paper, we address a new Driver-centric Service Delivery Problem (DSDP) from a cross-disciplinary resource allocation standpoint. Our goal is to deliver a number of services to a set of intended drivers in a given time period so as to maximize the system-wide performance in terms of total utility income (TUI) to drivers. We show that DSDP differs from all existing problems and is NP-Complete.

643,0,"Alleviating Solar Energy Congestion in the Distribution Grid via Smart Metering Communications The operation and control of the existing power grid system, which is challenged with rising demands and peak loads, has been considered passive. Congestion is often discovered in high-demand regions, and at locations where abundant renewable energy is generated and injected into the grid; this is attributed to a lack of transmission lines, transfer capability, and transmission capacity. While developing distributed generation (DG) tends to alleviate the traditional congestion problem, employing information and communications technology (ICT) helps manage DG more effectively. ICT involves a vast amount of data to facilitate a broader knowledge of the network status. Data computation and communications are critical elements that can impact the system performance. In this paper, we consider congestion caused by power surpluses produced from households' solar units on rooftops or on ground. Disconnecting some solar units is required to maintain the reliability of the distribution grid. We propose a model for the disconnection process via smart metering communications between smart meters and the utility control center. By modeling the surplus congestion issue as a knapsack problem, we can solve it by proposed greedy solutions.

644,0,"Detection of Faults and Attacks Including False Data Injection Attack in Smart Grid Using Kalman Filter By exploiting the communication infrastructure among the sensors, actuators, and control systems, attackers may compromise the security of smart-grid systems, with techniques such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack, random attack, and data-injection attack. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of the system to study these pitfalls and propose a robust security framework for the smart grid. Our framework adopts the Kalman filter to estimate the variables of a wide range of state processes in the model. The estimates from the Kalman filter and the system readings are then fed into the χ2-detector or the proposed Euclidean detector. The χ2-detector is a proven effective exploratory method used with the Kalman filter for the measurement of the relationship between dependent variables and a series of predictor variables. The χ2-detector can detect system faults/attacks, such as DoS attack, short-term, and long-term random attacks. However, the studies show that the χ2-detector is unable to detect the statistically derived false data-injection attack.

Many problems must be faced: adaptivity, hybrid control strategies, system (hardware) integration, and ubiquitous networking access. In this paper, a solution that attempts to provide a flexible and dependable solution to these complicated problems is illustrated. First, an extensible markup language (XML)-derived technologies is proposed to define fuzzy markup language (FML), a markup language skilled for defining detailed structure of fuzzy control independent from its legacy representation. FML is essentially composed of three layers: 1) XML in order to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control; 2) document type definition in order to define the legal building blocks; and 3) extensible stylesheet language transformations in order to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific programming language. Then an agent-based framework designed for providing proactive services in domotic environments, is presented. The agent architecture, exploiting mobile computation, is able to maximize the fuzzy control deployment for the natively FML representation by performing an efficient distribution of pieces of the global control flow over the different computers. Agents are also used to capture user habits, to identify requests, and to apply the artefact-mediated activity through an adaptive fuzzy control strategy.

646,0,"A Fuzzy Logic-Based System for Indoor Localization Using WiFi in Ambient Intelligent Environments Ambient intelligence is a new information paradigm, where people are empowered through a digital environment that is ``aware'' of their presence and context and is sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to their needs. Hence, one of the important requirements for ambient intelligent environments (AIEs) is the ability to localize the whereabouts of the user in the AIE to address her/his needs. In order to protect user privacy, the use of cameras is not desirable in AIEs, and hence, there is a need to rely on nonintrusive sensors. There are various localization means that are available for outdoor spaces such as those which rely on satellite signals triangulation. However, these outdoor localization means cannot be used in indoor environments. The majority of nonintrusive and noncamera-based indoor localization systems require the installation of extra hardware such as ultrasound emitters/antennas, radio-frequency identification (RFID) antennas, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization system that is based on WiFi signals which are free to receive, and they are available in abundance in the majority of domestic spaces. However, free WiFi signals are noisy and uncertain, and their strengths and availability are continuously changing. Hence, we present a fuzzy logic-based system which employs free available WiFi signals to localize a given user in AIEs. The proposed system receives WiFi signals from a large number of existing WiFi access points (up to 170 access points), where no prior knowledge of the access points locations and the environment is required. The system employs an incremental lifelong learning approach to adjust its behavior to the varying and changing WiFi signals to provide a zero-cost localization system which can provide high accuracy in real-world living spaces. We have compared our system in both simulated and real environments with other relevant techniques in the literature, and we have found that our system outperforms the other systems in the offline learning process, whereas our system was the only system which is capable of performing online learning and adaptation.

651,0,"Camouflage Traffic: Minimizing Message Delay for Smart Grid Applications under Jamming Smart grid is a cyber-physical system that integrates power infrastructures with information technologies. To facilitate efficient information exchange, wireless networks have been proposed to be widely used in the smart grid. However, the jamming attack that constantly broadcasts radio interference is a primary security threat to prevent the deployment of wireless networks in the smart grid. Hence, spread spectrum systems, which provide jamming resilience via multiple frequency and code channels, must be adapted to the smart grid for secure wireless communications, while at the same time providing latency guarantee for control messages. An open question is how to minimize message delay for timely smart grid communication under any potential jamming attack. To address this issue, we provide a paradigm shift from the case-by-case methodology, which is widely used in existing works to investigate well-adopted attack models, to the worst-case methodology, which offers delay performance guarantee for smart grid applications under any attack. We first define a generic jamming process that characterizes a wide range of existing attack models. Then, we show that in all strategies under the generic process, the worst-case message delay is a U-shaped function of network traffic load. This indicates that, interestingly, increasing a fair amount of traffic can in fact improve the worst-case delay performance. As a result, we demonstrate a lightweight yet promising system, transmitting adaptive camouflage traffic (TACT), to combat jamming attacks. TACT minimizes the message delay by generating extra traffic called camouflage to balance the network load at the optimum. Experiments show that TACT can decrease the probability that a message is not delivered on time in order of magnitude. jamming, power system security, probability, radio networks, radiofrequency interference, smart power grids, telecommunication security, telecommunication traffic, U-shaped function, network traffic load, transmitting adaptive camouflage traffic, TACT, network load balance, probability, worst-case message delay, existing attack model, generic jamming process, delay performance guarantee, well-adopted attack model, smart grid communication, control messages, latency guarantee, multiple-frequency channel, wireless communication security, code channel, jamming resilience, spread spectrum systems, primary security threat, radio interference broadcast, jamming attack, wireless network deployment, information exchange, information technologies, power infrastructures, cyber-physical system, smart grid application, message delay minimization, camouflage traffic, Power distibution, Smart grids, Delays, Receivers, Wireless networks, Communication system security, Smart grid, wireless applications, performance modeling, worst-case analysis, message delay, jamming attacks",camouflage traffic minimizing message delay for smart grid applications under jamming smart grid is a cyber physical system that integrates power infrastructures with information technologies to facilitate efficient information exchange wireless networks have been proposed to be widely used in the smart grid however the jamming attack that constantly broadcasts radio interference is a primary security threat to prevent the deployment of wireless networks in the smart grid hence spread spectrum systems which provide jamming resilience via multiple frequency and code channels must be adapted to the smart grid for secure wireless communications while at the same time providing latency guarantee for control messages an open question is how to minimize message delay for timely smart grid communication under any potential jamming attack to address this issue we provide a paradigm shift from the case by case methodology which is widely used in existing works to investigate well adopted attack models to the worst case methodology which offers delay performance guarantee for smart grid applications under any attack we first define a generic jamming process that characterizes a wide range of existing attack models then we show that in all strategies under the generic process the worst case message delay is a u shaped function of network traffic load this indicates that interestingly increasing a fair amount of traffic can in fact improve the worst case delay performance as a result we demonstrate a lightweight yet promising system transmitting adaptive camouflage traffic tact to combat jamming attacks tact minimizes the message delay by generating extra traffic called camouflage to balance the network load at the optimum experiments show that tact can decrease the probability that a message is not delivered on time in order of magnitude jamming power system security probability radio networks radiofrequency interference smart power grids telecommunication security telecommunication traffic u shaped function network traffic load transmitting adaptive camouflage traffic tact network load balance probability worst case message delay existing attack model generic jamming process delay performance guarantee well adopted attack model smart grid communication control messages latency guarantee multiple frequency channel wireless communication security code channel jamming resilience spread spectrum systems primary security threat radio interference broadcast jamming attack wireless network deployment information exchange information technologies power infrastructures cyber physical system smart grid application message delay minimization camouflage traffic power distibution smart grids delays receivers wireless networks communication system security smart grid wireless applications performance modeling worst case analysis message delay jamming attacks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Each agent can partially observe a part of the global dynamical process and estimate the associated local states through a combination of traditional Kalman filtering algorithm and consensus. The local estimates are then used for state feedback control. The optimal feedback gain of individual agents is obtained through dynamically solving a moving horizon linear quadratic optimization problem. The agents also exchange information among neighbors to coordinate the agent-wise state-feedback controls. Finally, a control decision incurring the least cost among all agents is applied to the global system. A Lyapunov function-based stability analysis is performed to obtain a bound over the degree of agent negotiation in designing the control decision. Besides, the effect of lossy communication network in control design and henceforth in global system stability is also investigated and the corresponding bound in control consensus is obtained.

658,0,"Scalable Distributed Communication Architectures to Support Advanced Metering Infrastructure in Smart Grid In this paper, we investigate the scalability of three communication architectures for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grid. AMI in smart grid is a typical cyber-physical system (CPS) example, in which large amount of data from hundreds of thousands of smart meters are collected and processed through an AMI communication infrastructure. Scalability is one of the most important issues for the AMI deployment in smart grid. In this study, we introduce a new performance metric, accumulated bandwidthdistance product (ABDP), to represent the total communication resource usages. For each distributed communication architecture, we formulate an optimization problem and obtain the solutions for minimizing the total cost of the system that considers both the ABDP and the deployment cost of the meter data management system (MDMS). The simulation results indicate the significant benefits of the distributed communication architectures over the traditional centralized one. More importantly, we analyze the scalability of the total cost of the communication system (including MDMS) with regard to the traffic load on the smart meters for both the centralized and the distributed communication architectures. Through the closed form expressions obtained in our analysis, we demonstrate that the total cost for the centralized architecture scales linearly as O(λN), with N being the number of smart meters, and λ being the average traffic rate on a smart meter. In contrast, the total cost for the fully distributed communication architecture is O(λ2/3N2/3), which is significantly lower. optimisation, power engineering computing, power system measurement, smart power grids, telecommunication traffic, scalable distributed communication architectures, advanced metering infrastructure, AMI communication infrastructure, smart grid, cyber physical system, smart meters, accumulated bandwidth distance product, ABDP, optimization problem, deployment cost, meter data management system, MDMS, traffic load, centralized architecture, Smart grids, Scalability, Computer architecture, Servers, Distributed databases, Internet, Measurement, Smart grids, Scalability, Computer architecture, Servers, Distributed databases, Internet, Measurement, facility location problem., Scalability, smart grid, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), meter data management system (MDMS)",scalable distributed communication architectures to support advanced metering infrastructure in smart grid in this paper we investigate the scalability of three communication architectures for advanced metering infrastructure ami in smart grid ami in smart grid is a typical cyber physical system cps example in which large amount of data from hundreds of thousands of smart meters are collected and processed through an ami communication infrastructure scalability is one of the most important issues for the ami deployment in smart grid in this study we introduce a new performance metric accumulated bandwidthdistance product abdp to represent the total communication resource usages for each distributed communication architecture we formulate an optimization problem and obtain the solutions for minimizing the total cost of the system that considers both the abdp and the deployment cost of the meter data management system mdms the simulation results indicate the significant benefits of the distributed communication architectures over the traditional centralized one more importantly we analyze the scalability of the total cost of the communication system including mdms with regard to the traffic load on the smart meters for both the centralized and the distributed communication architectures through the closed form expressions obtained in our analysis we demonstrate that the total cost for the centralized architecture scales linearly as o n with n being the number of smart meters and being the average traffic rate on a smart meter in contrast the total cost for the fully distributed communication architecture is o 2 3n2 3 which is significantly lower optimisation power engineering computing power system measurement smart power grids telecommunication traffic scalable distributed communication architectures advanced metering infrastructure ami communication infrastructure smart grid cyber physical system smart meters accumulated bandwidth distance product abdp optimization problem deployment cost meter data management system mdms traffic load centralized architecture smart grids scalability computer architecture servers distributed databases internet measurement smart grids scalability computer architecture servers distributed databases internet measurement facility location problem scalability smart grid advanced metering infrastructure ami meter data management system mdms,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Our laboratory's current research focuses on the monitoring of elderly people at home, to detect a loss of autonomy as early as possible. Our aim is to quantify criteria such as the international activities of daily living (ADL) or the French Autonomie Gerontologie Groupes Iso-Ressources (AGGIR) scales, by automatically classifying the different ADL performed by the subject during the day. A Health Smart Home is used for this. Our Health Smart Home includes, in a real flat, infrared presence sensors (location), door contacts (to control the use of some facilities), temperature and hygrometry sensor in the bathroom, and microphones (sound classification and speech recognition). A wearable kinematic sensor also informs postural transitions (using pattern recognition) and walk periods (frequency analysis). This data collected from the various sensors are then used to classify each temporal frame into one of the ADL that was previously acquired (seven activities: hygiene, toilet use, eating, resting, sleeping, communication, and dressing/undressing). This is done using support vector machines.

In this paper, we switch our view from single-point to multi-point and study the important problem of privacy-preserving multi-point traffic volume measurement in vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs), which complements the state of the art. While embracing automatic traffic data collection, which the VCPS provides through vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, we also need to accept the accompanying challenges: First, the privacy of all participating vehicles should be preserved as an inherent requirement of a VCPS; second, the measurement scheme should be efficient enough to fit today's large-scale vehicular networks.

664,0,"Shipboard Power Systems Reconfiguration---A Cyber-Physical Framework For Response Time Analysis Several applications within a shipboard system involve the integration of physical systems (e.g., power systems) and cyber computing platforms such as command and control, communications, and sensing networks, and require real-time quality of service (QoS) guarantees. In this paper, the distribution of total (end-to-end) delay associated with fault diagnosis and reconfiguration of shipboard power system (SPS) is investigated from a cyber-physical systems (CPS) perspective. Specifically, a cross-layer end-to-end delay analysis framework is introduced for SPS reconfiguration. The proposed framework stochastically models the heterogeneity of actions of various subsystems involved in the reconfiguration tasks viz., generation of fault information by sensor nodes associated to the power system, processing of actions at control center to resolve fault locations and reconfiguration, and flow of information through communication network to perform necessary actions. The proposed framework then combines appropriately the output delay distributions from each subsystem to: 1) analytically predict the distribution of end-to-end delay in SPS reconfiguration after the occurrence of faults and 2) analyze and design real-time reconfiguration solutions for shipboard CPS, that meet total delay requirements. Simulations using various topological scenarios demonstrate that the proposed analytical framework closely predict the total delay associated with SPS reconfiguration. delays, embedded systems, fault location, marine power systems, power engineering computing, power system faults, power system reliability, quality of service, stochastic processes, wireless sensor networks, shipboard power system, cyber-physical system, response time analysis, cyber computing, delay distribution, fault diagnosis, cross-layer end-to-end delay analysis, SPS reconfiguration, stochastic model, fault information generation, sensor node, action heterogeneity processing, control center, fault location, information flow, communication network, shipboard CPS, delay requirement, QoS, Cyber-physical systems, delay distribution, end-to-end response time analysis framework, real-time quality of service (QoS), sensor topology, shipboard power system (SPS)",shipboard power systems reconfiguration a cyber physical framework for response time analysis several applications within a shipboard system involve the integration of physical systems e g power systems and cyber computing platforms such as command and control communications and sensing networks and require real time quality of service qos guarantees in this paper the distribution of total end to end delay associated with fault diagnosis and reconfiguration of shipboard power system sps is investigated from a cyber physical systems cps perspective specifically a cross layer end to end delay analysis framework is introduced for sps reconfiguration the proposed framework stochastically models the heterogeneity of actions of various subsystems involved in the reconfiguration tasks viz generation of fault information by sensor nodes associated to the power system processing of actions at control center to resolve fault locations and reconfiguration and flow of information through communication network to perform necessary actions the proposed framework then combines appropriately the output delay distributions from each subsystem to 1 analytically predict the distribution of end to end delay in sps reconfiguration after the occurrence of faults and 2 analyze and design real time reconfiguration solutions for shipboard cps that meet total delay requirements simulations using various topological scenarios demonstrate that the proposed analytical framework closely predict the total delay associated with sps reconfiguration delays embedded systems fault location marine power systems power engineering computing power system faults power system reliability quality of service stochastic processes wireless sensor networks shipboard power system cyber physical system response time analysis cyber computing delay distribution fault diagnosis cross layer end to end delay analysis sps reconfiguration stochastic model fault information generation sensor node action heterogeneity processing control center fault location information flow communication network shipboard cps delay requirement qos cyber physical systems delay distribution end to end response time analysis framework real time quality of service qos sensor topology shipboard power system sps,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
665,0,"AmIRTEM: A Functional Model for Training of Aerobic Endurance for Health Improvement In a nonstrenuous exercise, the heart rate (HR) shows a linear relationship with the maximum volume of oxygen consumption VO2Max and serves as an indicator of performance of the cardiovascular system. The HR replaces the %VO2Max in exercise program prescription to improve aerobic endurance. In order to achieve an optimal effect in an endurance training, the athlete needs to work out at an HR high enough to trigger the aerobic metabolism, while avoiding the very high HRs that bring along significant risks of myocardial infarction. The minimal and optimal base training programs, followed by stretching exercises to prevent injuries, are adequate programs to maximize benefits and minimize health risks for the cardiovascular system during single session training. In this paper, we have defined a functional model for an ambient intelligence system that monitors, evaluates, and trains the aerobic endurance. It is based on the Android operating system and the Gow Running smart shirt. The system has been evaluated during functional assessment stress testing of aerobic endurance in the Stress Physiology Laboratory (SPL) of the Technical University of Madrid. Furthermore, a voice system designed to guide the user through minimal and optimal base training programs has been evaluated.

With the objective of developing a robustness theory for CPS, we introduce a notion of robustness for cyber systems inspired by existing notions of input-output stability in control theory. We show that the proposed notion of robustness captures two intuitive goals: bounded disturbances lead to bounded deviations from nominal behavior, and the effect of a sporadic disturbance disappears in finitely many steps. For cyber systems modeled as finite-state transducers, the proposed notion of robustness can be verified in pseudo-polynomial time.

Power-line communication (PLC) presents a 'no new wires' solution for home networks. However, power line is a troublesome and noisy platform for home networks. And the traditional approach with PLC is interference-limited and has a small bandwidth. In this paper we propose a new scheme of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to provide better noise-limited PLC networks. This schema is based on loosely synchronous (LS) codes with very nice correlations. Construction criteria of LS codes used in the proposed system are provided and discussed. The capacity properties and spectral efficiency of LS coded OFDM systems over PLC channels are also studied in this paper.

681,0,"Design and Evaluation of a Dual Impedance-Adapting Power-Line Communications Coupler Historically, the unpredictable on-off switching of loads has been a major obstacle to low-voltage power-line communications. Some researchers have gathered valuable data and have proposed statistical models in order to try and mitigate these sudden changes in access impedance. Others have proposed network conditioning in order to ¿block off¿ harsh loads from the power-line network by means of series filters. These filters are expensive, as they have to be rated at the typical current that is drawn by the load to be `blocked off'. Also, in many cases, these are the very loads than need to be monitored and controlled for home automation. This paper investigates the possibility of utilizing a simple, dual coupler to diminish the impact of switching loads on data transmission. First, the design of a suitable dual coupler is demonstrated, using a commercially available high-frequency transformer. Next, laboratory as well as live 220-V measurements are done for 50-¿ modems at frequencies below 1 MHz. These measurements confirm that the proposed dual coupler can help to counter the impact of switching power-line loads by means of (i) improved transmission when a certain network point is loaded and (ii) more predictable (lower) power-line impedance levels-facilitating more accurate overall impedance adaptation. carrier transmission on power lines, electric connectors, power filters, statistical analysis, transformers, dual impedance-adapting power-line communications coupler, loads on-off switching, statistical models, power-line network, series filters, home automation, data transmission, high-frequency transformer, power-line impedance, voltage 220 V, resistance 50 ohm, Impedance, Couplings, Filters, Communication switching, Computerized monitoring, Automatic control, Home automation, Data communication, Laboratories, Frequency measurement, Coupling circuits, impedance matching, modems, transformers",design and evaluation of a dual impedance adapting power line communications coupler historically the unpredictable on off switching of loads has been a major obstacle to low voltage power line communications some researchers have gathered valuable data and have proposed statistical models in order to try and mitigate these sudden changes in access impedance others have proposed network conditioning in order to block off harsh loads from the power line network by means of series filters these filters are expensive as they have to be rated at the typical current that is drawn by the load to be blocked off also in many cases these are the very loads than need to be monitored and controlled for home automation this paper investigates the possibility of utilizing a simple dual coupler to diminish the impact of switching loads on data transmission first the design of a suitable dual coupler is demonstrated using a commercially available high frequency transformer next laboratory as well as live 220 v measurements are done for 50 modems at frequencies below 1 mhz these measurements confirm that the proposed dual coupler can help to counter the impact of switching power line loads by means of i improved transmission when a certain network point is loaded and ii more predictable lower power line impedance levels facilitating more accurate overall impedance adaptation carrier transmission on power lines electric connectors power filters statistical analysis transformers dual impedance adapting power line communications coupler loads on off switching statistical models power line network series filters home automation data transmission high frequency transformer power line impedance voltage 220 v resistance 50 ohm impedance couplings filters communication switching computerized monitoring automatic control home automation data communication laboratories frequency measurement coupling circuits impedance matching modems transformers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

A learning technique that is used to provide the SS with the so-called Autobiographical Memory is presented here by drawing inspiration from a bio-inspired model of the interactions occurring between the system and the user. Starting from the hypothesis that user's actions have a direct influence on the internal system state variables and vice versa, a statistical voting algorithm is proposed for inferring the cause/effect relationships among users and the system. The main contribution of this paper lies in proposing a general framework that is able to allow the SS to be aware of its present state as well as of the behavior of its users and to be able to predict the expected consequences of user actions. bio-inspired materials, brain models, brain-computer interfaces, learning (artificial intelligence), neurophysiology, statistical analysis, interaction modeling, smart space, bioinspired approach, autobiographical memory, proactive interaction, neurophysiological observation, human brain structure, learning technique, state variable, statistical voting algorithm, Predictive models, Ambient intelligence, Humans, Artificial intelligence, Intelligent sensors, Sensor systems, Biomedical engineering, Space technology, Learning, Intelligent robots, Bio-inspired learning, dynamic interactions modeling, event prediction, Smart Space (SS)",interaction modeling and prediction in smart spaces a bio inspired approach based on autobiographical memory in smart spaces sss the capability of learning from experience is fundamental for autonomous adaptation to environmental changes and for proactive interaction with users new research trends for reaching this goal are based on neurophysiological observations of human brain structure and functioning a learning technique that is used to provide the ss with the so called autobiographical memory is presented here by drawing inspiration from a bio inspired model of the interactions occurring between the system and the user starting from the hypothesis that user s actions have a direct influence on the internal system state variables and vice versa a statistical voting algorithm is proposed for inferring the cause effect relationships among users and the system the main contribution of this paper lies in proposing a general framework that is able to allow the ss to be aware of its present state as well as of the behavior of its users and to be able to predict the expected consequences of user actions bio inspired materials brain models brain computer interfaces learning artificial intelligence neurophysiology statistical analysis interaction modeling smart space bioinspired approach autobiographical memory proactive interaction neurophysiological observation human brain structure learning technique state variable statistical voting algorithm predictive models ambient intelligence humans artificial intelligence intelligent sensors sensor systems biomedical engineering space technology learning intelligent robots bio inspired learning dynamic interactions modeling event prediction smart space ss,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
683,0,"EPS: An Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Service Searching Scheme for Smart Community Smart community leverages information and communications technology to improve the quality of life in terms of education, health care, and government services. In smart community, residents manage their home appliances to cooperate on stabilizing renewable power supply, energy saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations. cooperative systems, data privacy, home automation, Internet, Internet of Things, wireless LAN, smart community, efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme, Internet bandwidth, pervasive Internet access, cost, EPS, WiFi bandwidth, proximity score, location privacy preservation, multiple pseudonym techniques, privacy analyses, identity privacy, communication efficiency, Internet of Things, Internet of Things, smart community, privacy preservation, cooperative network",eps an efficient and privacy preserving service searching scheme for smart community smart community leverages information and communications technology to improve the quality of life in terms of education health care and government services in smart community residents manage their home appliances to cooperate on stabilizing renewable power supply energy saving and information communications in this paper we propose an efficient and privacy preserving service searching scheme eps for smart community to enable residents to receive some internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive internet access at the cheap cost specifically the eps enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via wifi as the internet and wifi bandwidth for homes is limited the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities the priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process moreover the eps preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided in addition the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations cooperative systems data privacy home automation internet internet of things wireless lan smart community efficient and privacy preserving service searching scheme internet bandwidth pervasive internet access cost eps wifi bandwidth proximity score location privacy preservation multiple pseudonym techniques privacy analyses identity privacy communication efficiency internet of things internet of things smart community privacy preservation cooperative network,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

691,0,"A Framework for Evaluating Stereo-Based Pedestrian Detection Techniques Automated pedestrian detection, counting, and tracking have received significant attention in the computer vision community of late. As such, a variety of techniques have been investigated using both traditional 2-D computer vision techniques and, more recently, 3-D stereo information. However, to date, a quantitative assessment of the performance of stereo-based pedestrian detection has been problematic, mainly due to the lack of standard stereo-based test data and an agreed methodology for carrying out the evaluation. This has forced researchers into making subjective comparisons between competing approaches. In this paper, we propose a framework for the quantitative evaluation of a short-baseline stereo-based pedestrian detection system.

Since such prevalent home network environments frequently deal with private and sensitive information, it is crucial to legitimately provide access control for protecting such emerging environments. As a result, the open services gateway initiative (OSGi) attempted to address this critical issue. However, the current OSGi authorization mechanism is not rigorous enough to fulfill security requirements involved in dynamic OSGi environments.

Sensor data fusion algorithms are developed in this work to aggregate data collected through this probe data service for computing single-RSU and multi-RSU average per-division speeds and average route travel times, where a division is defined to be a small segment of a road. These algorithms are evaluated using an integrated simulation testbed that consists of a vehicular simulator and a wireless communication link simulator, which are interconnected via a TCP/IP connection. Our key findings are that the probe data service offers an excellent means for computing average per-division speeds and average route travel times when the market penetration level of OBUs is relatively high.

695,0,"Communication Synchronization in Cluster-Based Sensor Networks for Cyber-Physical Systems A reliable, scalable, and low-delay information collection network is an essential component in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Cluster-based sensor network is a good candidate because of its advantage in increasing scalability, improving energy efficiency, and providing QoS guarantees. However, in such networks, frequent interactions between the intra-cluster communication and the inter-cluster communication are inevitable, which may severely downgrade the communication efficiency and hence the network performance if not handled properly. Proper synchronization among these two types of communications is required. In this paper, we propose two approaches to schedule the communications in clustered wireless sensor networks aiming at delay-sensitive applications. In the first approach, an efficient cycle-based synchronous scheduling is proposed to achieve low average packet delay and high throughput by optimizing the cycle length and transmission order. In the second approach, a novel clustering structure is introduced to eliminate the necessity of communication synchronization so that packets are transmitted with no synchronization delay, yielding very low end-to-end packet delay. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of both the approaches. These two approaches are then integrated as a hybrid scheme that allows smooth switching between them. The hybrid scheme takes advantage of both the approaches and enables cluster-based sensor networks to serve as the fundamental network infrastructure for information collection in CPS. quality of service, scheduling, synchronisation, telecommunication network topology, wireless sensor networks, end to end packet delay, low average packet delay, cycle-based synchronous scheduling, delay-sensitive application, wireless sensor network, intercluster communication, intracluster communication, QoS guarantee, energy efficiency, low-delay information collection network, cyber-physical system, cluster-based sensor network, communication synchronization, Communication networks, Wireless sensor networks, Synchronization, Scheduling, Optimal scheduling, Time division multiple access, Clustering, wireless sensor networks, communication synchronization, delay-sensitive, data gathering",communication synchronization in cluster based sensor networks for cyber physical systems a reliable scalable and low delay information collection network is an essential component in cyber physical systems cps cluster based sensor network is a good candidate because of its advantage in increasing scalability improving energy efficiency and providing qos guarantees however in such networks frequent interactions between the intra cluster communication and the inter cluster communication are inevitable which may severely downgrade the communication efficiency and hence the network performance if not handled properly proper synchronization among these two types of communications is required in this paper we propose two approaches to schedule the communications in clustered wireless sensor networks aiming at delay sensitive applications in the first approach an efficient cycle based synchronous scheduling is proposed to achieve low average packet delay and high throughput by optimizing the cycle length and transmission order in the second approach a novel clustering structure is introduced to eliminate the necessity of communication synchronization so that packets are transmitted with no synchronization delay yielding very low end to end packet delay our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of both the approaches these two approaches are then integrated as a hybrid scheme that allows smooth switching between them the hybrid scheme takes advantage of both the approaches and enables cluster based sensor networks to serve as the fundamental network infrastructure for information collection in cps quality of service scheduling synchronisation telecommunication network topology wireless sensor networks end to end packet delay low average packet delay cycle based synchronous scheduling delay sensitive application wireless sensor network intercluster communication intracluster communication qos guarantee energy efficiency low delay information collection network cyber physical system cluster based sensor network communication synchronization communication networks wireless sensor networks synchronization scheduling optimal scheduling time division multiple access clustering wireless sensor networks communication synchronization delay sensitive data gathering,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
696,0,"Interference Mitigation for Cyber-Physical Wireless Body Area Network System Using Social Networks Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are cyber-physical systems that emerged as a key technology to provide real-time health monitoring and ubiquitous healthcare services. WBANs could operate in dense environments such as in a hospital and lead to a high mutual communication interference in many application scenarios. The excessive interferences will significantly degrade the network performance, including depleting the energy of WBAN nodes more quickly and even eventually jeopardize people's lives because of unreliable (caused by the interference) healthcare data collections. Therefore, it is critical to mitigate the interference among WBANs to increase the reliability of the WBAN system while minimizing the system power consumption. Many existing approaches can deal with communication interference mitigation in general wireless networks but are not suitable for WBANs because of ignoring the social nature of WBANs by them. Unlike the previous research, we for the first time propose a power game based approach to mitigate the communication interferences for WBANs based on the people's social interaction information. Our major contributions include: 1) modeling the inter-WBANs interference and determine the distance distribution of the interference through both theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations; 2) developing social interaction detection and prediction algorithms for people carrying WBANs; and 3) developing a power control game based on the social interaction information to maximize the system's utility while minimize the energy consumption of WBANs system. The extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of the power control game for inter-WBAN interference mitigation using social interaction information.

Research activities in this topic are oriented toward new materials and nanotechnologies, thus requiring new instruments for the sensor characterization and management. Often, in order to improve selectivity, sensitivity, stability, the sensor is heated according to purposely designed profiles. The repeatability of the measurement conditions strongly depends on the ability to perform a sensor resistance measurement in a synchronous fashion with respect to the imposed thermal profile. This work proposes an electronic equipment for a complete management of a generic MOX sensor. The system is able to estimate the sensor resistance in a range varying from tens of kilohms up to tens of gigohms, while driving the sensor heater with a thermal profile designed by the user. Thanks to the short readout time (10 ms) and to the synchronism between the heater management and the sensor resistance measurement, the system is suitable for monitoring fast transients and thermal dynamics of the sensors. In addition, an estimation of the sensor parasitic capacitance, modeled in parallel with the resistive part and on the order of few picofarads, is provided for diagnostic purposes.

Existing assistive technology solutions that provide access as user input devices are intrusive and expensive, and require physical contact that can have deleterious effects such as skin friction injury for paralyzed users who have reduced skin sensitivity. To address this problem, in this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a non-contact proximity gesture recognition system using fabric capacitive sensor arrays. The fabric sensors are lightweight, flexible, and can be easily integrated into items of quotidian use such as clothing, bed sheets, and pillow covers. Our gesture recognition algorithm builds on two known classification techniques, Hidden Markov Model and Dynamic Time Warping to convert raw capacitance values to alphanumeric gestures. Our system is personalized to the user, allowing personalized selection of gesture sets and definition of gesture patterns in accordance with their capabilities.

This paper extends the Aloha games to spatial reuse scenarios, and studies the system equilibrium and performance.

In order to monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design technologies that recognize and track activities that people normally perform as part of their daily routines. Although approaches do exist for recognizing activities, the approaches are applied to activities that have been preselected and for which labeled training data are available. In contrast, we introduce an automated approach to activity tracking that identifies frequent activities that naturally occur in an individual's routine. With this capability, we can then track the occurrence of regular activities to monitor functional health and to detect changes in an individual's patterns and lifestyle.

However, due to characteristics of renewable energy such as intermittent energy generation, home energy management systems are inefficient and the recent systems therefore cannot be successfully applied to existing home. Therefore, this paper proposes intelligent cloud home energy management system (iCHEMS), considering these issues. iCHEMS assigns dynamic priority to a household appliance according to the type of appliance and its current status. In accordance with the assigned priority, the use of household appliances is scheduled considering renewable energy capability.

704,0,"A Deconvolutive Neural Network for Speech Classification With Applications to Home Service Robot Reverberation deteriorates the quality and intelligibility of speech, leading to the poor performance of classification systems. Room reverberation parameters depend on the location of the speaker and the microphone and the room geometry. For mobile robots, the reverberation is constantly changing due to the relative movement of the speaker and the robot. This can affect the spectral properties of the signal and therefore, the classification accuracy. The contribution of this paper is a new network architecture, which uses neural network constant modulus algorithm (NNCMA) based equalizer followed by a multi-layer preceptron (MLP) classifier. NNCMA is an MLP which is trained with a cost function similar to constant modulus algorithm (CMA). With this two-stage structure, the classifier does not have to consider the time-varying nature of the reverberation. The proposed algorithm is applied to speech samples collected by the home service robot WEVER-R2 for speaker classification in a typical home or office environment. We use them for gender classification application. The proposed neural network was found to have 83.73% of classification accuracy for age classification and 88.91% of classification accuracy for gender classification, while the standard MLP had a classification accuracy of 71.43% and 72.29%, respectively. blind equalisers, deconvolution, home automation, human-robot interaction, mobile robots, multilayer perceptrons, reverberation, service robots, speech intelligibility, speech recognition, deconvolutive neural network, speech classification, home service robot, mobile robot, multilayer preceptron classifier, constant modulus algorithm, room reverberation, WEVER-R2, speaker classification, Artificial neural networks, Speech, Service robots, Deconvolution, Neural networks, Reverberation, Multilayer perceptrons, Blind deconvolution, constant modulus algorithm (CMA), multilayer perceptron, neural network, reverberation, robotics, speech classification",a deconvolutive neural network for speech classification with applications to home service robot reverberation deteriorates the quality and intelligibility of speech leading to the poor performance of classification systems room reverberation parameters depend on the location of the speaker and the microphone and the room geometry for mobile robots the reverberation is constantly changing due to the relative movement of the speaker and the robot this can affect the spectral properties of the signal and therefore the classification accuracy the contribution of this paper is a new network architecture which uses neural network constant modulus algorithm nncma based equalizer followed by a multi layer preceptron mlp classifier nncma is an mlp which is trained with a cost function similar to constant modulus algorithm cma with this two stage structure the classifier does not have to consider the time varying nature of the reverberation the proposed algorithm is applied to speech samples collected by the home service robot wever r2 for speaker classification in a typical home or office environment we use them for gender classification application the proposed neural network was found to have 83 73 of classification accuracy for age classification and 88 91 of classification accuracy for gender classification while the standard mlp had a classification accuracy of 71 43 and 72 29 respectively blind equalisers deconvolution home automation human robot interaction mobile robots multilayer perceptrons reverberation service robots speech intelligibility speech recognition deconvolutive neural network speech classification home service robot mobile robot multilayer preceptron classifier constant modulus algorithm room reverberation wever r2 speaker classification artificial neural networks speech service robots deconvolution neural networks reverberation multilayer perceptrons blind deconvolution constant modulus algorithm cma multilayer perceptron neural network reverberation robotics speech classification,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Still, most controller systems provide separate control user interfaces for different uses when users inevitably face an increased number of interfaces for control and interaction tasks in such environment. To simplify burdens of user and reduce complexities in control tasks, we propose a universal appliance controller based on mobile device with two selective interaction modes. First mode is a network scanning-based indirect interaction mode which provides fast and reliable connection to the appliances with specific filters in the networked environment. Second mode is a camera-based direct interaction mode which provides an intuitive interface as an input device. These two modes are interchangeable for different tasks and according to user's preference. Moreover, control user interface is personalized with preference described in user profile to reflect the user of the system better.

The proposed method uses the IR emitter of the RVC to project a horizontal IR beam toward the floor, following which the RVC's wide-angle vision camera captures an image that includes the IR line reflected by the floor or an obstacle. Obstacles are detected by using the image coordinates of the pixels that belong to the IR line in the captured image.

718,0,"The Evolution of MAC Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become a leading solution in many important applications such as intrusion detection, target tracking, industrial automation, smart building and so on. Typically, a WSN consists of a large number of small, low-cost sensor nodes that are distributed in the target area for collecting data of interest. For a WSN to provide high throughput in an energy-efficient way, designing an efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is of paramount importance because the MAC layer coordinates nodes' access to the shared wireless medium. To show the evolution of WSN MAC protocols, this article surveys the latest progresses in WSN MAC protocol designs over the period 2002-2011. In the early development stages, designers were mostly concerned with energy efficiency because sensor nodes are usually limited in power supply. Recently, new protocols are being developed to provide multi-task support and efficient delivery of bursty traffic. Therefore, research attention has turned back to throughput and delay. This article details the evolution of WSN MAC protocols in four categories: asynchronous, synchronous, frame-slotted, and multichannel. These designs are evaluated in terms of energy efficiency, data delivery performance, and overhead needed to maintain a protocol's mechanisms. With extensive analysis of the protocols many future directions are stated at the end of this survey. The performance of different classes of protocols could be substantially improved in future designs by taking into consideration the recent advances in technologies and application demands. access protocols, wireless sensor networks, MAC protocols, wireless sensor networks, WSN, data of interest, medium access control protocol, Media Access Protocol, Wireless sensor networks, Receivers, Data communication, Schedules, Throughput, Wireless sensor networks, MAC protocols, energy efficiency, time-critical, TDMA, multichannel",the evolution of mac protocols in wireless sensor networks a survey wireless sensor networks wsns have become a leading solution in many important applications such as intrusion detection target tracking industrial automation smart building and so on typically a wsn consists of a large number of small low cost sensor nodes that are distributed in the target area for collecting data of interest for a wsn to provide high throughput in an energy efficient way designing an efficient medium access control mac protocol is of paramount importance because the mac layer coordinates nodes access to the shared wireless medium to show the evolution of wsn mac protocols this article surveys the latest progresses in wsn mac protocol designs over the period 2002 2011 in the early development stages designers were mostly concerned with energy efficiency because sensor nodes are usually limited in power supply recently new protocols are being developed to provide multi task support and efficient delivery of bursty traffic therefore research attention has turned back to throughput and delay this article details the evolution of wsn mac protocols in four categories asynchronous synchronous frame slotted and multichannel these designs are evaluated in terms of energy efficiency data delivery performance and overhead needed to maintain a protocol s mechanisms with extensive analysis of the protocols many future directions are stated at the end of this survey the performance of different classes of protocols could be substantially improved in future designs by taking into consideration the recent advances in technologies and application demands access protocols wireless sensor networks mac protocols wireless sensor networks wsn data of interest medium access control protocol media access protocol wireless sensor networks receivers data communication schedules throughput wireless sensor networks mac protocols energy efficiency time critical tdma multichannel,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
719,0,"Shrinkage Algorithms for MMSE Covariance Estimation We address covariance estimation in the sense of minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) when the samples are Gaussian distributed. Specifically, we consider shrinkage methods which are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples (large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) method by conditioning on a sufficient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this yields a new estimator called RBLW, whose mean-squared error dominates that of LW for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle approximating shrinkage (OAS) estimator. Both RBLW and OAS estimators have simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are developed from different perspectives, their structure is identical up to specified constants. The RBLW estimator provably dominates the LW method for Gaussian samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the OAS approach can perform even better than RBLW, especially when n is much less than p .

720,0,"A Cyber--Physical Systems Approach to Data Center Modeling and Control for Energy Efficiency This paper presents data centers from a cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective. Current methods for controlling information technology (IT) and cooling technology (CT) in data centers are classified according to the degree to which they take into account both cyber and physical considerations. To evaluate the potential impact of coordinated CPS strategies at the data center level, we introduce a control-oriented model that represents the data center as two coupled networks: a computational network representing the cyber dynamics and a thermal network representing the physical dynamics. These networks are coupled through the influence of the IT on both networks: servers affect both the quality of service (QoS) delivered by the computational network and the generation of heat in the thermal network. Using this model, three control strategies are evaluated with respect to their energy efficiency and computational performance: a baseline strategy that ignores CPS considerations, an uncoordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT independently, and a coordinated strategy that manages the IT and CT together to achieve optimal performance with respect to both QoS and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the benefits to be realized from coordinating the control of IT and CT depend on the distribution and heterogeneity of the computational and cooling resources throughout the data center. A new cyber-physical index (CPI) is introduced as a measure of this combined distribution of cyber and physical effects in a given data center. We illustrate how the CPI indicates the potential impact of using coordinated CPS control strategies. computer centres, cooling, energy conservation, heat systems, information technology, network servers, power aware computing, quality of service, thermal variables control, cyber physical systems, data center modeling, data center control, energy efficiency, CPS, information technology, computational network, cyber dynamics, thermal network, physical dynamics, quality of service, QoS, heat generation, server affect, baseline strategy, uncoordinated strategy, optimal performance, cooling resources, heterogeneity, computational distribution, computational heterogeneity, cyber- physical index, CPI, CPS control strategies, Data centers, Thermal management, Power demand, Computational modeling, Data models, Energy efficiency, Heating, Cyberspace, Network topology, Power system control, Computer applications, Computer applications, cyber--physical systems, data centers, energy efficiency, predictive control, thermal management",a cyber physical systems approach to data center modeling and control for energy efficiency this paper presents data centers from a cyber physical system cps perspective current methods for controlling information technology it and cooling technology ct in data centers are classified according to the degree to which they take into account both cyber and physical considerations to evaluate the potential impact of coordinated cps strategies at the data center level we introduce a control oriented model that represents the data center as two coupled networks a computational network representing the cyber dynamics and a thermal network representing the physical dynamics these networks are coupled through the influence of the it on both networks servers affect both the quality of service qos delivered by the computational network and the generation of heat in the thermal network using this model three control strategies are evaluated with respect to their energy efficiency and computational performance a baseline strategy that ignores cps considerations an uncoordinated strategy that manages the it and ct independently and a coordinated strategy that manages the it and ct together to achieve optimal performance with respect to both qos and energy efficiency simulation results show that the benefits to be realized from coordinating the control of it and ct depend on the distribution and heterogeneity of the computational and cooling resources throughout the data center a new cyber physical index cpi is introduced as a measure of this combined distribution of cyber and physical effects in a given data center we illustrate how the cpi indicates the potential impact of using coordinated cps control strategies computer centres cooling energy conservation heat systems information technology network servers power aware computing quality of service thermal variables control cyber physical systems data center modeling data center control energy efficiency cps information technology computational network cyber dynamics thermal network physical dynamics quality of service qos heat generation server affect baseline strategy uncoordinated strategy optimal performance cooling resources heterogeneity computational distribution computational heterogeneity cyber physical index cpi cps control strategies data centers thermal management power demand computational modeling data models energy efficiency heating cyberspace network topology power system control computer applications computer applications cyber physical systems data centers energy efficiency predictive control thermal management,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Each ultrasonic sensor module includes a transmitter and a receiver, and the modules are placed in a line direction. Because the ultrasonic transmission will spread at a beam angle, we use multiple ultrasonic receivers to receive the ultrasonic transmission. If any intruder passes through the ultrasonic sensing area, the ultrasonic transmission will be blocked by the human body. As the receivers will not receive any transmission from the ultrasonic transmitter, the system will sense when someone is passing through the surveillance area.

The method introduces an on-line energy management by using a hierarchical controller between three energy sources: photovoltaic (PV) panels, battery storage and proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The proposed method includes a feed-forward, back-propagation neural network controller in the first layer, which is added in order to achieve the maximum power point for the different types of PV panels. In the second layer, a fuzzy logic controller has been developed to optimise performance by distributing the power inside the hybrid system and by managing the charge and discharge of the current flow. Finally, and in the third layer, local controllers are presented to regulate the fuel cell/battery set points in order to reach to best performance. Moreover, perturb and observe algorithm with two different controller techniques - the linear proportional-integral (PI) and the non-linear passivity-based controller - are provided for a comparison with the proposed maximum power point tracking controller system. The comparison revealed the robustness of the proposed PV control system for solar irradiance and load resistance changes.

This paper proposes automated algorithms for the unobtrusive measurement of SiSt timing and symmetry using bed pressure sensors. An integrated signal comprising all of the sensor outputs was analyzed to measure both the bed-departure timing and the timing of three clinical phases within the transfer. Data collected in clinical trials, along with independent clinical video analysis, verified the success of the bed-departure timing algorithm with a mean error of 0.11 s. The phase measurement algorithm showed significant differences (p <; 0.001) between younger and older adults in Phases II and III of the transfers, comparing well with studies found in recent clinical literature. The sensor outputs were then used to form sequences of pressure images, and an automated region of interest (ROI) detection algorithm was designed to extract regional signals from the hips and the hands. The final algorithm was designed to measure the symmetry of the body throughout the SiSt transfer from the extracted regional signals. A system accuracy of 93.0% was obtained for the automated symmetry classification of transfers. The techniques proposed in this paper can increase the precision and efficiency in clinical SiSt assessments.

A wireless communication infrastructure is assumed for the smart meter network. The dynamics of the power market are assumed to be a Markov decision process (MDP) by modeling the power load evolution as a two-state Markov chain. The fundamental elements of the MDP are discussed and the optimal strategy is obtained from dynamic programming. Due to the curse of dimensions, the myopic strategy is proposed to significantly simplify the algorithm. The validity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations.

730,0,"A New Intelligent Neuro--Fuzzy Paradigm for Energy-Efficient Homes Demand response (DR), which is the action voluntarily taken by a consumer to adjust amount or timing of its energy consumption, has an important role in improving energy efficiency. With DR, we can shift electrical load from peak demand time to other periods based on changes in price signal. At residential level, automated energy management systems (EMS) have been developed to assist users in responding to price changes in dynamic pricing systems. In this paper, a new intelligent EMS (iEMS) in a smart house is presented. It consists of two parts: a fuzzy subsystem and an intelligent lookup table. The fuzzy subsystem is based on its fuzzy rules and inputs that produce the proper output for the intelligent lookup table. The second part, whose core is a new model of an associative neural network, is able to map inputs to desired outputs. The structure of the associative neural network is presented and discussed. The intelligent lookup table takes three types of inputs that come from the fuzzy subsystem, outside sensors, and feedback outputs.

731,0,"Control and learning of ambience by an intelligent building Modern approaches to the architecture of living and working environments emphasize the dynamic reconfiguration of space and function to meet the needs, comfort, and preferences of its inhabitants. Although it is possible for a human operator to specify a configuration explicitly, the size, sophistication, and dynamic requirements of modern buildings demands that they have autonomous intelligence that could satisfy the needs of its inhabitants without human intervention. We describe a multiagent framework for such intelligent building control that is deployed in a commercial building equipped with sensors and effectors. Multiple agents control subparts of the environment using fuzzy rules that link sensors and effectors. The agents communicate with one another by asynchronous, interest-based messaging. They implement a novel unsupervised online real-time learning algorithm that constructs a fuzzy rule-base, derived from very sparse data in a nonstationary environment.

732,0,"Energy Management Policies for Energy-Neutral Source-Channel Coding In cyber-physical systems where sensors measure the temporal evolution of a given phenomenon of interest and radio communication takes place over short distances, the energy spent for source acquisition and compression may be comparable with that used for transmission. Additionally, in order to avoid limited lifetime issues, sensors may be powered via energy harvesting and thus collect all the energy they need from the environment. This work addresses the problem of energy allocation over source acquisition/compression and transmission for energy-harvesting sensors. At first, focusing on a single-sensor, energy management policies are identified that guarantee a minimum average distortion while at the same time ensuring the stability of the queue connecting source and channel encoders. It is shown that the identified class of policies is optimal in the sense that it stabilizes the queue whenever this is feasible by any other technique that satisfies the same average distortion constraint. Moreover, this class of policies performs an independent resource optimization for the source and channel encoders. Suboptimal strategies that do not use the energy buffer (battery) or use it only for adapting either source or channel encoder energy allocation are also studied for performance comparison. The problem of optimizing the desired trade-off between average distortion and backlog size is then formulated and solved via dynamic programming tools.

736,0,"Cooperative Message Authentication in Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems The vehicular ad hoc network presents a very complex cyber-physical system with intricate interplay between the physical and cyber domains. In the physical domain, vehicles need to frequently broadcast their geographic information. The safety message broadcasting in an area with a high density of vehicles tends to incur a large data traffic rate that should be properly processed in the cyber domain. In this paper, we address the issue of large computation overhead caused by the safety message authentication. Especially, a cooperative message authentication protocol (CMAP) is developed to alleviate vehicles' computation burden. With CMAP, all the vehicles share their verification results with each other in a cooperative way, so that the number of safety messages that each vehicle needs to verify reduces significantly. Furthermore, we study the verifier selection algorithms for a high detection rate of invalid messages in a practical 2-D road scenario. Another important contribution in this paper is that we develop an analytical model for CMAP and the existing probabilistic verification protocol , considering the hidden terminal impact. Simulation results over a practical map are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed CMAP with comparison to the existing method. message authentication, probability, protocols, telecommunication security, vehicular ad hoc networks, cooperative message authentication, vehicular cyber physical systems, vehicular ad hoc network, geographic information, safety message broadcasting, safety message authentication, cooperative message authentication protocol, CMAP, safety messages, probabilistic verification protocol, hidden terminal impact, Intelligent vehicles, Protocols, Road vehicles, Authentication, Vehicular ad hoc networks, Vehicle safety, Privacy, Network security, Authentication, Vehicular ad hoc network, security, safety applications, cooperative authentication, missed detection ratio",cooperative message authentication in vehicular cyber physical systems the vehicular ad hoc network presents a very complex cyber physical system with intricate interplay between the physical and cyber domains in the physical domain vehicles need to frequently broadcast their geographic information the safety message broadcasting in an area with a high density of vehicles tends to incur a large data traffic rate that should be properly processed in the cyber domain in this paper we address the issue of large computation overhead caused by the safety message authentication especially a cooperative message authentication protocol cmap is developed to alleviate vehicles computation burden with cmap all the vehicles share their verification results with each other in a cooperative way so that the number of safety messages that each vehicle needs to verify reduces significantly furthermore we study the verifier selection algorithms for a high detection rate of invalid messages in a practical 2 d road scenario another important contribution in this paper is that we develop an analytical model for cmap and the existing probabilistic verification protocol considering the hidden terminal impact simulation results over a practical map are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed cmap with comparison to the existing method message authentication probability protocols telecommunication security vehicular ad hoc networks cooperative message authentication vehicular cyber physical systems vehicular ad hoc network geographic information safety message broadcasting safety message authentication cooperative message authentication protocol cmap safety messages probabilistic verification protocol hidden terminal impact intelligent vehicles protocols road vehicles authentication vehicular ad hoc networks vehicle safety privacy network security authentication vehicular ad hoc network security safety applications cooperative authentication missed detection ratio,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
737,0,"Covariance Estimation in Decomposable Gaussian Graphical Models Graphical models are a framework for representing and exploiting prior conditional independence structures within distributions using graphs. In the Gaussian case, these models are directly related to the sparsity of the inverse covariance (concentration) matrix and allow for improved covariance estimation with lower computational complexity. We consider concentration estimation with the mean-squared error (MSE) as the objective, in a special type of model known as decomposable. This model includes, for example, the well known banded structure and other cases encountered in practice. Our first contribution is the derivation and analysis of the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) in decomposable graphical models. We provide a simple closed form solution to the MVUE and compare it with the classical maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in terms of performance and complexity. Next, we extend the celebrated Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) to graphical models. Using SURE, we prove that the MSE of the MVUE is always smaller or equal to that of the biased MLE, and that the MVUE itself is dominated by other approaches. In addition, we propose the use of SURE as a constructive mechanism for deriving new covariance estimators. Similarly to the classical MLE, all of our proposed estimators have simple closed form solutions but result in a significant reduction in MSE. computational complexity, covariance analysis, Gaussian distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, mean square error methods, signal processing, covariance estimation, decomposable Gaussian graphical models, prior conditional independence structures, inverse covariance matrix sparsity, MVUE, mean-squared error, MSE, computational complexity, minimum variance unbiased estimation, maximum likelihood estimator, MLE, Stein's unbiased risk estimate, SURE, statistical signal processing, Graphical models, Maximum likelihood estimation, Array signal processing, Covariance matrix, Gaussian distribution, Computational complexity, Closed-form solution, Signal processing algorithms, Parameter estimation, Ambient intelligence, Covariance estimation, graphical models, minimum variance unbiased estimation",covariance estimation in decomposable gaussian graphical models graphical models are a framework for representing and exploiting prior conditional independence structures within distributions using graphs in the gaussian case these models are directly related to the sparsity of the inverse covariance concentration matrix and allow for improved covariance estimation with lower computational complexity we consider concentration estimation with the mean squared error mse as the objective in a special type of model known as decomposable this model includes for example the well known banded structure and other cases encountered in practice our first contribution is the derivation and analysis of the minimum variance unbiased estimator mvue in decomposable graphical models we provide a simple closed form solution to the mvue and compare it with the classical maximum likelihood estimator mle in terms of performance and complexity next we extend the celebrated stein s unbiased risk estimate sure to graphical models using sure we prove that the mse of the mvue is always smaller or equal to that of the biased mle and that the mvue itself is dominated by other approaches in addition we propose the use of sure as a constructive mechanism for deriving new covariance estimators similarly to the classical mle all of our proposed estimators have simple closed form solutions but result in a significant reduction in mse computational complexity covariance analysis gaussian distribution maximum likelihood estimation mean square error methods signal processing covariance estimation decomposable gaussian graphical models prior conditional independence structures inverse covariance matrix sparsity mvue mean squared error mse computational complexity minimum variance unbiased estimation maximum likelihood estimator mle stein s unbiased risk estimate sure statistical signal processing graphical models maximum likelihood estimation array signal processing covariance matrix gaussian distribution computational complexity closed form solution signal processing algorithms parameter estimation ambient intelligence covariance estimation graphical models minimum variance unbiased estimation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
738,0,"A Practical Evaluation of Information Processing and Abstraction Techniques for the Internet of Things The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interaction and communication between billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real-world objects (i.e. things). Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data.

740,0,"Autonomous Localization of an Unknown Number of Targets Without Data Association Using Teams of Mobile Sensors This paper considers situations in which a team of mobile sensor platforms autonomously explores an environment to detect and localize an unknown number of targets. Individual sensors may be unreliable, failing to detect objects within the field-of-view, returning false positive measurements to clutter objects, and being unable to disambiguate true targets. In this setting, data association is difficult. We utilize the PHD filter for multitarget localization, simultaneously estimating the number of objects and their locations within the environment without the need to explicitly consider data association. Using sets of potential actions generated at multiple length scales for each robot, the team selects the joint action that maximizes the expected information gain over a finite time horizon. This is computed as the mutual information between the set of targets and the binary events of receiving no detections, effectively hedging against uninformative actions in a computationally tractable manner. We frame the controller as a receding-horizon problem. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of the proposed autonomous exploration strategy through hardware experiments, exploring an office environment with a team of ground robots. We also conduct a series of simulated experiments, varying the planning method, target cardinality, environment, and sensor modality. Note to Practitioners-Teams of small robots have the potential to automate many information gathering tasks, relaying data back to a base station or human operator from multiple vantage points within an environment. The information gathering tasks we consider in this work are those in which the number of objects being sought is not known at the onset of exploration. Such tasks are common in security and surveillance, where the number of such objects is often zero; search and rescue, where, for example, the number of people trapped due to a natural disaster can be large; or smart building/smart city applications, where the data collection needs may be on an even larger scale. This paper seeks to address the problem of automating this data collection process, so that a team of mobile sensor platforms are able to autonomously explore a given environment in order to determine the number of objects of interest and their locations, while avoiding any explicit data association, i.e., matching individual measurements to targets. mobile robots, multi-robot systems, path planning, sensor fusion, mobile sensor teams, target detection, target localization, data association, PHD filter, multitarget localization, finite time horizon, receding-horizon problem, ground robot team, planning method, target cardinality, sensor modality, information gathering tasks, Robot sensing systems, Robot kinematics, Target tracking, Joints, Mutual information, Cooperative systems, distributed tracking, information theory, robot sensing systems, robots",autonomous localization of an unknown number of targets without data association using teams of mobile sensors this paper considers situations in which a team of mobile sensor platforms autonomously explores an environment to detect and localize an unknown number of targets individual sensors may be unreliable failing to detect objects within the field of view returning false positive measurements to clutter objects and being unable to disambiguate true targets in this setting data association is difficult we utilize the phd filter for multitarget localization simultaneously estimating the number of objects and their locations within the environment without the need to explicitly consider data association using sets of potential actions generated at multiple length scales for each robot the team selects the joint action that maximizes the expected information gain over a finite time horizon this is computed as the mutual information between the set of targets and the binary events of receiving no detections effectively hedging against uninformative actions in a computationally tractable manner we frame the controller as a receding horizon problem we demonstrate the real world applicability of the proposed autonomous exploration strategy through hardware experiments exploring an office environment with a team of ground robots we also conduct a series of simulated experiments varying the planning method target cardinality environment and sensor modality note to practitioners teams of small robots have the potential to automate many information gathering tasks relaying data back to a base station or human operator from multiple vantage points within an environment the information gathering tasks we consider in this work are those in which the number of objects being sought is not known at the onset of exploration such tasks are common in security and surveillance where the number of such objects is often zero search and rescue where for example the number of people trapped due to a natural disaster can be large or smart building smart city applications where the data collection needs may be on an even larger scale this paper seeks to address the problem of automating this data collection process so that a team of mobile sensor platforms are able to autonomously explore a given environment in order to determine the number of objects of interest and their locations while avoiding any explicit data association i e matching individual measurements to targets mobile robots multi robot systems path planning sensor fusion mobile sensor teams target detection target localization data association phd filter multitarget localization finite time horizon receding horizon problem ground robot team planning method target cardinality sensor modality information gathering tasks robot sensing systems robot kinematics target tracking joints mutual information cooperative systems distributed tracking information theory robot sensing systems robots,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
741,0,"Probabilistic Learning From Incomplete Data for Recognition of Activities of Daily Living in Smart Homes Learning behavioral patterns for activities of daily living in a smart home environment can be challenged by the limited number of training data that may be available. This may be due to the infrequent repetition of routine activities (e.g., once daily), the expense of using observers to label activities, and the intrusion that would be caused by the presence of observers over long time periods. It is important, therefore, to make as much use of any labeled data that are collected, however, incomplete these data may be. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for learning behavioral patterns for multi-inhabitants living in a single smart home environment, by making full use of all limited labeled activities, including incomplete data resulting from unreliable low-level sensors in this environment. Through maximum-likelihood estimation, using Expectation-Maximization, we build a model that captures both environmental uncertainties from sensor readings and user uncertainties, including variations in how individuals carry out activities. Our algorithm outperforms models that cannot handle data incompleteness, with increasing performance gains as incompleteness increases.

744,0,"CMOS Neuromorphic Optical Sensor Chip With Color Change-Intensity Change Disambiguation (CCICD) In this paper, we propose a novel terrestrial retina-like neuromorphic sensor chip which can (1) perform irradiance and color detection via two pathways simultaneously and (2) can perform color change-intensity change disambiguation (CCICD). The irradiance detection pathway has a wide-dynamic detection range, spanning 3 orders of magnitude, and is robust to background light variations. The color detection pathway has a buried double junction photodiode as the photoreceptor followed by two parallel logarithmic I-V convertors whose outputs go to a differential amplifier.

745,0,"Investigation on Erosion of Cu/W Contacts in High-Voltage Circuit Breakers The prediction and understanding of the erosion process of the Cu/W arcing contacts in high-voltage circuit breakers is important for the improvement of the breaker lifetime. The change of the contact geometry due to erosion is a main factor, which influences the lifetime. It is known that the ablation of contact material depends at least on parameters like the arcing current-amplitude, arcing time, total charge, and contact material properties. Based on experimental results, a method for an improved prediction of the erosion was derived. The experiments have been carried out in a SF6self-blast circuit breaker test device with commercial high-voltage circuit breaker contacts at a current amplitude up to 45kA RMS and arcing time up to 17ms. From the power balance at the electrodes, the material erosion due to evaporation is calculated. The resulting erosion rates are in good agreement to the experimental results and explain that the specific erosion scales with current, polarity, and the arcing time. This indicates that erosion in this range of arcing stress occurs mainly due to evaporation of contact material and less to emission of droplets circuit breakers, circuit-breaking arcs, copper, electrical contacts, high-voltage engineering, tungsten, contact erosion, high-voltage circuit breakers, contact geometry, contact material, arcing contacts, Cu-W, Circuit breakers, Circuit testing, Copper, Electrodes, Voltage, Geometry, Stress, Heating, Ambient intelligence, Tungsten, Arcing contacts, copper--tungsten, erosion, high-voltage circuit breakers",investigation on erosion of cu w contacts in high voltage circuit breakers the prediction and understanding of the erosion process of the cu w arcing contacts in high voltage circuit breakers is important for the improvement of the breaker lifetime the change of the contact geometry due to erosion is a main factor which influences the lifetime it is known that the ablation of contact material depends at least on parameters like the arcing current amplitude arcing time total charge and contact material properties based on experimental results a method for an improved prediction of the erosion was derived the experiments have been carried out in a sf6self blast circuit breaker test device with commercial high voltage circuit breaker contacts at a current amplitude up to 45ka rms and arcing time up to 17ms from the power balance at the electrodes the material erosion due to evaporation is calculated the resulting erosion rates are in good agreement to the experimental results and explain that the specific erosion scales with current polarity and the arcing time this indicates that erosion in this range of arcing stress occurs mainly due to evaporation of contact material and less to emission of droplets circuit breakers circuit breaking arcs copper electrical contacts high voltage engineering tungsten contact erosion high voltage circuit breakers contact geometry contact material arcing contacts cu w circuit breakers circuit testing copper electrodes voltage geometry stress heating ambient intelligence tungsten arcing contacts copper tungsten erosion high voltage circuit breakers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
746,0,"A Novel Minimum-Size Activation Function and Its Derivative This brief presents two novel architectures, i.e., a nonlinear neural activation function and its derivative. Both are suitable for implementations of neurons in multilayer perceptron networks with an on-chip backpropagation learning algorithm. The activation function proposed shows minimal area and power consumption, can be considered as an approximation to the tanh(nx) function, and can be programmed to achieve any slope at the origin that is equal to or greater than 2. The derivative proposed also shows minimal area and maximizes its similarity, with the ideal derivative in the proximities of the origin being the best approximation for its degree of complexity. Both topologies are designed with subthreshold metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors in order to minimize power consumption. Likewise, they have been designed with balanced and fully differential topologies, so that external influences, offset, and distortion of even order are reduced. Moreover, a detailed analysis using the General Translinear Principle shows that the activation function is being affected by the body effect but the derivative function is immune to it.

Unlike existing solutions in literature, the proposed algorithm is distributed in nature, such that each network base station / access point can perform its own resource allocation to support the MTs according to their service classes. The coordination among different available wireless access networks' base stations is established via the MT multiple radio interfaces in order to provide the required bandwidth to each MT.

It is considered a main component of ubiquitous computing. This work focuses on sensor networks, the main infrastructure for context-aware service in ubiquitous home network. The context-aware services will trigger intelligent and automatic services according to the context information based on the sensor platform context in the future home. This service requires accurate sensing information about the environment or user, (which is gathered via information exchange among sensors without human intervention) and management of this information. Hence, if the intelligent service develops configuration and control problems related to some sensed information. Such problem causes interaction issues which require an optimal solution. This paper's proposed model, implements a location tracking system, sensor information management (SIM) model, and mechanism, which can gather optimal information through the interaction within sensed information.

755,0,"A real-time voice service with the adaptive packet loss recovery scheme in the hybrid residential gateway system This paper presents a real-time voice service with the adaptive packet loss recovery scheme based on the H.323 protocol, which is one of the service functionalities of the hybrid residential gateway system. The proposed scheme analyzes the characteristics of packet losses based on the Gilbert model, and then describes a mechanism that can recover the lost audio packets with the offset redundant data. Using information periodically reported by a receiver, the sender dynamically adjusts the amount and the offset values of redundant data, with a constraint of minimizing the bandwidth consumption of links. Since the wireless environments could be often characterized by frequent and consecutive packet losses, loss recovery mechanisms need to deal with both the random and consecutive packet losses efficiently. To achieve this, the suggested mechanism uses relatively large and discontinuous exponential offset values. To verify the effectiveness of the mechanism, we extended and implemented RTP/RTCP protocols and applications in the hybrid residential gateway system. The experimental results show that our mechanism, with exponential offset, achieves remarkably low complete packet loss rate and adapts dynamically to the fluctuation of the packet loss pattern in the wired and wireless environments. voice communication, packet radio networks, adaptive systems, internetworking, network servers, transport protocols, network interfaces, wide area networks, broadband networks, wireless LAN, real-time voice service, adaptive packet loss recovery, hybrid residential gateway system, H.323 protocol, Gilbert model, audio packets recovery, offset redundant data, bandwidth consumption minimization, wireless environments, loss recovery mechanisms, consecutive packet losses, random packet losses, RTP RTCP protocols, packet loss rate, packet loss pattern, wired environment, wide area network, WAN, local area network, LAN, interface device, broadband network, in-home network, Bandwidth, Protocols, Home automation, Postal services, Multimedia systems, Internet, Fluctuations, Mediation, Optical fiber networks, Optical receivers",a real time voice service with the adaptive packet loss recovery scheme in the hybrid residential gateway system this paper presents a real time voice service with the adaptive packet loss recovery scheme based on the h 323 protocol which is one of the service functionalities of the hybrid residential gateway system the proposed scheme analyzes the characteristics of packet losses based on the gilbert model and then describes a mechanism that can recover the lost audio packets with the offset redundant data using information periodically reported by a receiver the sender dynamically adjusts the amount and the offset values of redundant data with a constraint of minimizing the bandwidth consumption of links since the wireless environments could be often characterized by frequent and consecutive packet losses loss recovery mechanisms need to deal with both the random and consecutive packet losses efficiently to achieve this the suggested mechanism uses relatively large and discontinuous exponential offset values to verify the effectiveness of the mechanism we extended and implemented rtp rtcp protocols and applications in the hybrid residential gateway system the experimental results show that our mechanism with exponential offset achieves remarkably low complete packet loss rate and adapts dynamically to the fluctuation of the packet loss pattern in the wired and wireless environments voice communication packet radio networks adaptive systems internetworking network servers transport protocols network interfaces wide area networks broadband networks wireless lan real time voice service adaptive packet loss recovery hybrid residential gateway system h 323 protocol gilbert model audio packets recovery offset redundant data bandwidth consumption minimization wireless environments loss recovery mechanisms consecutive packet losses random packet losses rtp rtcp protocols packet loss rate packet loss pattern wired environment wide area network wan local area network lan interface device broadband network in home network bandwidth protocols home automation postal services multimedia systems internet fluctuations mediation optical fiber networks optical receivers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0

758,0,"Relative Thresholding With Under-Mattress Pressure Sensors to Detect Central Apnea Unobtrusive pressure sensors can be used for biological monitoring and long-term health assessment in smart homes. The challenge in detecting events from smart home data is that people have different mattresses, unlike in hospitals where bedding is standardized. This paper proposes to model central apneas using an under-mattress pressure sensor as a measuring instrument. The model uses three parameters, namely, a relative threshold and two time lengths, applied to a moving variance signal. The use of a relative threshold allows apneas to be detected under a variety of different conditions and improves results compared to hard-coded thresholds. The algorithm developed herein was applied to simulated apneas collected from pressure sensors placed under nine different mattresses. The parameters determined from the training set were applied to the test set and produced classification results of 0.78 positive predictive value (PPV) if the bed occupant's position is known and 0.75 PPV if the position is unknown.

759,0,"An Advanced Home Energy Management System Facilitated by Nonintrusive Load Monitoring With Automated Multiobjective Power Scheduling Nowadays, electricity energy demands requested from down-stream sectors in a smart grid constantly increase. One way to meet those demands is use of home energy management systems (HEMS). By effectively scheduling major household appliances in response to demand response (DR) schemes, residents can save their electricity bills. In this paper, an advanced HEMS facilitated by a nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique with an automated nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II)-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism is proposed. The NILM as an electricity audit is able to nonintrusively estimate power consumed by each of monitored major household appliances at a certain period of time. Data identified by the NILM are very useful for DR implementation. For DR implementation, the NSGA-II-based multiobjective in-home power scheduling mechanism autonomously and meta-heuristically schedules monitored and enrolled major household appliances without user intervention. It is based on an analysis of the NILM with historical data with past trends.

762,0,"An interactive space that learns to influence human behavior A key question in the design of intelligent environments is how a space can influence the actions of its users, and how such behavior can be learned. We present the results of experiments conducted as part of the Ada project, an interactive entertainment exhibit deployed at the Swiss national exhibition Expo.02. We used a learning model called distributed adaptive control (DAC) that is based on the animal learning paradigms of classical and operant conditioning. DAC has been developed using mobile robots in foraging tasks. Here, it was applied to the learning of effective cues for guiding visitors in a given direction.

Many visitors could be induced to move toward a region of the space that they normally avoided visiting-an effect that can be seen as a spatial classification of visitors into interactive and noninteractive categories.

763,0,"Toward Secure Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks Low rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) offer device level wireless connectivity. They bring to light a host of new applications as well as enhance existing applications. Due to their low cost, low power consumption and self-organization features, LR-WPANs are ideal for applications such as public security, battle field monitoring, inventory tracking, as well as home and office automation. Nevertheless, one critical issue, security, needs to be solved before LR-WPANs are commonly accepted. Pursuing security in LR-WPANs is a challenging task. On one hand, wireless communications are inherently susceptible to interception and interference. On the other hand, most devices in LR-WPANs are resource-constrained and lack physical safeguards. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the threats faced by LR-WPANs with respect to the protocol stack defined by IEEE 802.15.4 and the ZigBee Alliance.

766,0,"Automatic Configuration of Video-Surveillance Applications: a Model-Driven Experience The number of video-surveillance applications has increased in the last years due to the increasing security requirements, especially in public buildings. In that sense, new types of applications have appeared with new services. As an example, digital applications allow the possibility of remotely controlling the video through internet. However, most of these applications are implemented ad-hoc. They are very tied to the programming level reducing thus their reusability, configurability and maintainability. In this setting, we propose a Model-Driven approach to develop video-surveillance applications. This approach is based on the utilization of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that allows the design of these applications at the modeling level. The utilization of models enhance the reusability of the services provided by the systems but also aims at managing their variability making them highly configurable. The models built based on this DSL are then used by model transformations that are able to automatically generate the configuration of the applications so that they may be dynamically reconfigured. Moreover, the approach provides different versions of the system, namely a standalone application, a web application or an application for mobile devices. All these applications allow the remote control of the video installation and the integration of external services such as SMS alerts, vehicles' plate recognition or smart home control.

772,0,"GT2FC: An Online Growing Interval Type-2 Self-Learning Fuzzy Classifier In this paper, we propose a Growing Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier (GT2FC) for online rule learning from real-time data streams. While in batch rule learning, the training data are assumed to be drawn from a stationary distribution, in online rule learning, data can dynamically change over time becoming potentially nonstationary. To accommodate dynamic change, GT2FC relies on a new semi-supervised online learning algorithm called Growing Gaussian Mixture Model (2G2M). In particular, 2G2M is used to generate the type-2 fuzzy membership functions to build the type-2 fuzzy rules. GT2FC is designed to accommodate data online and to reconcile labeled and unlabeled data using self-learning. Moreover, GT2FC maintains low complexity of the rule base using online optimization and feature selection mechanisms. GT2FC is tested on data obtained from an ambient intelligence application, where the goal is to exploit sensed data to monitor the living space on behalf of the inhabitants. Because sensors are prone to faults and noise, type-2 fuzzy modeling is very suitable for dealing with such an application.

773,0,"A New Method for Public Involvement in Electric Transmission-Line Routing Public participation in and acceptance of routing decisions for electric transmission lines has delayed and prevented the construction of numerous lines in recent decades. A new method of public participation called structured public involvement (SPI), developed previously by two of the authors for routing other public infrastructure, has been adapted to routing electric transmission lines. SPI elicits and quantifies community values then routes the line according to these values and best engineering design practices. The process is done before any potential routes are ever considered by the transmission company and routing professionals, effectively allowing the public, in collaboration with experts, to determine the line route. This reduces the chances of line routing failure by simplifying the project and greatly accelerating the complex problem of comparing alternate line routes, and it facilitates public acceptance of a final route. power transmission lines, electric transmission-line routing, structured public involvement, public participation, transmission company, routing professionals, Transmission lines, Routing, Power transmission lines, Geographic Information Systems, Meeting planning, Ambient intelligence, Delay lines, Collaboration, Acceleration, Power system planning, Decision support systems, geographic information systems (GIS), meetings, power distribution planning, power transmission planning, public involvement, public participation, routing",a new method for public involvement in electric transmission line routing public participation in and acceptance of routing decisions for electric transmission lines has delayed and prevented the construction of numerous lines in recent decades a new method of public participation called structured public involvement spi developed previously by two of the authors for routing other public infrastructure has been adapted to routing electric transmission lines spi elicits and quantifies community values then routes the line according to these values and best engineering design practices the process is done before any potential routes are ever considered by the transmission company and routing professionals effectively allowing the public in collaboration with experts to determine the line route this reduces the chances of line routing failure by simplifying the project and greatly accelerating the complex problem of comparing alternate line routes and it facilitates public acceptance of a final route power transmission lines electric transmission line routing structured public involvement public participation transmission company routing professionals transmission lines routing power transmission lines geographic information systems meeting planning ambient intelligence delay lines collaboration acceleration power system planning decision support systems geographic information systems gis meetings power distribution planning power transmission planning public involvement public participation routing,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

778,0,"Toward Emotion Aware Computing: An Integrated Approach Using Multichannel Neurophysiological Recordings and Affective Visual Stimuli This paper proposes a methodology for the robust classification of neurophysiological data into four emotional states collected during passive viewing of emotional evocative pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. The proposed classification model is formed according to the current neuroscience trends, since it adopts the independency of two emotional dimensions, namely arousal and valence, as dictated by the bidirectional emotion theory, whereas it is gender-specific. A two-step classification procedure is proposed for the discrimination of emotional states between EEG signals evoked by pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, which also vary in their arousal/intensity levels. The first classification level involves the arousal discrimination. The valence discrimination is then performed. The Mahalanobis (MD) distance-based classifier and support vector machines (SVMs) were used for the discrimination of emotions. The achieved overall classification rates were 79.5% and 81.3% for the MD and SVM, respectively, significantly higher than in previous studies.

782,0,"TESA: a temporal and spatial information aware writeback policy for home network-attached storage devices Home Network-Attached Storage (NAS) provides an easy way for data sharing and backup among multiple consumer electronic devices in home networks. Because of large capacity and cost effectiveness, disks are widely adopted in home NAS devices. In addition, data writes are common for many home NAS devices since these devices are usually used for data storage and backup. A writeback policy selects which dirty buffers are to be flushed to the disk, which is critical to the system performance under write-intensive workloads. In this paper, an intelligent writeback policy for home NAS called TESA is proposed. In contrast to most existing writeback policies, TESA considers both temporal and spatial information of the dirty buffers to improve the writeback performance. Considering the temporal information helps to reduce the frequency of writing back recently used dirty buffers, and hence leads to reduced write traffic. Considering the spatial information causes a reduction in the overall seek time and rotation delay of the dirty buffer writeback. The TESA writeback policy was implemented on a NAS evaluation board running Linux kernel. The performance results shows that TESA yields a significant performance improvement (i.e., up to 33.1%) over the original writeback policy of Linux. Moreover, TESA outperforms the policy that considers only the temporal information of the dirty buffers by up to 21.0%, and it also has up to 10.9% performance improvement over a previous policy that considers both the temporal and spatial information. buffer storage, home computing, TESA writeback policy, temporal-and-spatial information aware writeback policy, home network-attached storage device, data sharing, data backup, consumer electronic device, home NAS device, write-intensive workload, dirty buffer, Linux kernel, Operating systems, Linux, Delays, Writing, Performance evaluation, Home automation, Benchmark testing, Writeback policy, Buffer management, Home network-attached storage, Temporal information, Spatial information",tesa a temporal and spatial information aware writeback policy for home network attached storage devices home network attached storage nas provides an easy way for data sharing and backup among multiple consumer electronic devices in home networks because of large capacity and cost effectiveness disks are widely adopted in home nas devices in addition data writes are common for many home nas devices since these devices are usually used for data storage and backup a writeback policy selects which dirty buffers are to be flushed to the disk which is critical to the system performance under write intensive workloads in this paper an intelligent writeback policy for home nas called tesa is proposed in contrast to most existing writeback policies tesa considers both temporal and spatial information of the dirty buffers to improve the writeback performance considering the temporal information helps to reduce the frequency of writing back recently used dirty buffers and hence leads to reduced write traffic considering the spatial information causes a reduction in the overall seek time and rotation delay of the dirty buffer writeback the tesa writeback policy was implemented on a nas evaluation board running linux kernel the performance results shows that tesa yields a significant performance improvement i e up to 33 1 over the original writeback policy of linux moreover tesa outperforms the policy that considers only the temporal information of the dirty buffers by up to 21 0 and it also has up to 10 9 performance improvement over a previous policy that considers both the temporal and spatial information buffer storage home computing tesa writeback policy temporal and spatial information aware writeback policy home network attached storage device data sharing data backup consumer electronic device home nas device write intensive workload dirty buffer linux kernel operating systems linux delays writing performance evaluation home automation benchmark testing writeback policy buffer management home network attached storage temporal information spatial information,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Thus, posture is analyzed with simple and efficient features that are not designed to manage constraints related to the environment but only designed to describe human silhouettes. The posture recognition method, based on fuzzy logic, identifies four static postures and is robust to variation in the distance between the camera and the person, and to the person's morphology.

787,0,"An analog spread-spectrum interface for power-line data communication in home networking Communication using power line as a medium of signal transmission offers a convenient and inexpensive solution for multimedia signal transmission and control applications in smart home networking. This work presents a novel analog spread-spectrum (SS) scheme for physical-layer interface in home networking. The proposed communication scheme uses a chaotic system to modulate the information signal for wideband transmission. The wideband spectral property of the transmitted chaotic signal adds robustness to the proposed scheme against the hostile power-line environment that is characterized by non-Gaussian noise and multipath propagation. By exploiting the ergodic property of chaotic signals, a simple noncoherent receiver is developed here. Not only does the proposed analog scheme demonstrate satisfactory communication performance, but it can also be implemented with simple hardware and low manufacturing cost, which is an important consideration for cost-effective home networking. The proposed noncoherent SS system does not involve quantization and complex synchronization process and, hence, it is more efficient in transmitting analog multimedia signals compared to the conventional SS system. Performance analyses illustrate the superior communication performance of the proposed analog SS system over the conventional SS scheme for multimedia signal transmission in a power-line home networking environment. carrier transmission on power lines, chaotic communication, synchronisation, power cables, high-voltage engineering, analog spread-spectrum interface, power line data communication, home networking, signal transmission, multimedia signal transmission, analog spread-spectrum scheme, physical layer interface, wideband spectral property, transmitted chaotic signal, nonGaussian noise, multipath propagation, complex synchronization process, Spread spectrum communication, Data communication, Multimedia systems, Chaotic communication, Wideband, Communication system control, Smart homes, Noise robustness, Working environment noise, Hardware, Chaos, chaotic parameter modulation, home networking, multimedia signals, power-line communication, spread-spectrum (SS) modem",an analog spread spectrum interface for power line data communication in home networking communication using power line as a medium of signal transmission offers a convenient and inexpensive solution for multimedia signal transmission and control applications in smart home networking this work presents a novel analog spread spectrum ss scheme for physical layer interface in home networking the proposed communication scheme uses a chaotic system to modulate the information signal for wideband transmission the wideband spectral property of the transmitted chaotic signal adds robustness to the proposed scheme against the hostile power line environment that is characterized by non gaussian noise and multipath propagation by exploiting the ergodic property of chaotic signals a simple noncoherent receiver is developed here not only does the proposed analog scheme demonstrate satisfactory communication performance but it can also be implemented with simple hardware and low manufacturing cost which is an important consideration for cost effective home networking the proposed noncoherent ss system does not involve quantization and complex synchronization process and hence it is more efficient in transmitting analog multimedia signals compared to the conventional ss system performance analyses illustrate the superior communication performance of the proposed analog ss system over the conventional ss scheme for multimedia signal transmission in a power line home networking environment carrier transmission on power lines chaotic communication synchronisation power cables high voltage engineering analog spread spectrum interface power line data communication home networking signal transmission multimedia signal transmission analog spread spectrum scheme physical layer interface wideband spectral property transmitted chaotic signal nongaussian noise multipath propagation complex synchronization process spread spectrum communication data communication multimedia systems chaotic communication wideband communication system control smart homes noise robustness working environment noise hardware chaos chaotic parameter modulation home networking multimedia signals power line communication spread spectrum ss modem,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

There's no need to consider hardware when using a single bundle, because this was handled by hardware, service gateway specifications.

791,0,"DOGeye: Controlling your home with eye interaction Nowadays home automation, with its increased availability, reliability and with its ever reducing costs is gaining momentum and is starting to become a viable solution for enabling people with disabilities to autonomously interact with their homes and to better communicate with other people. However, especially for people with severe mobility impairments, there is still a lack of tools and interfaces for effective control and interaction with home automation systems, and general--purpose solutions are seldom applicable due to the complexity, asynchronicity, time dependent behavior, and safety concerns typical of the home environment. This paper focuses on user--environment interfaces based on the eye tracking technology, which often is the only viable interaction modality for users as such. We propose an eye-based interface tackling the specific requirements of smart environments, already outlined in a public Recommendation issued by the COGAIN European Network of Excellence. The proposed interface has been implemented as a software prototype based on the ETU universal driver, thus being potentially able to run on a variety of eye trackers, and it is compatible with a wide set of smart home technologies, handled by the Domotic OSGi Gateway. A first interface evaluation, with user testing sessions, has been carried and results show that the interface is quite effective and usable without discomfort by people with almost regular eye movement control.

792,0,"Ambient Ecologies in Smart Homes An important characteristic of ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) environments is the integration of information, communication and sensing technologies into our everyday objects, giving rise to a new proactive computing model in homes. A smart home uses networked sensors, devices and appliances to build an intelligent environment in which many activities in the home are automated and where devices and services seamlessly cooperate to support domestic tasks. Programming and maintaining such an infrastructure is challenging because suitable abstractions are currently missing. In this work we have attempted to define ambient ecologies as a metaphor for modeling UbiComp applications, specify design patterns and programming principles and develop infrastructure to provide a paradigm of application engineering and tools to support ambient ecology designers, developers and end-users.

793,0,"Performance analysis of FSK power line communications systems over the time-varying channels: measurements and modeling Power line communication (PLC) is a communications method where signals are carried across already existing power lines, rather than through other mediums such as optical fibers or radio waves. PLC has been a very important interdiscipline topic for power, communications, industrial, and automation engineers and researchers since the 1980s. Designing and planning optimized or standard PLC systems require information and data regarding signal attenuations, load variations, and communication performance for various locations of the world which have different power networks. In this study, PLC system is modeled by ABCD matrix and simulated via electronics workbench. In order to obtain data from Turkey's power lines, signal measurements at the frequencies of 50-200 kHz are carried out.

795,0,"PALDi: Online Load Disaggregation via Particle Filtering Smart metering and fine-grained energy data are one of the major enablers for future smart grid and improved energy efficiency in smart homes. Using the information provided by smart meter power draw, valuable information can be extracted as disaggregated appliance power draws by non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). NILM allows to identify appliances according to their power characteristics in the total power consumption of a household, measured by one sensor, the smart meter. In this paper, we present an NILM approach, where the appliance states are estimated by particle filtering (PF). PF is used for nonlinear and non-Gaussian disturbed problems and is suitable to estimate the appliance state. ON/OFF appliances, multistate appliances, or combinations of them are modeled by hidden Markov models, and their combinations result in a factorial hidden Markov model modeling the household power demand. We evaluate the PF-based NILM approach on synthetic and on real data from a well-known dataset to show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 90% on real household power draws. domestic appliances, Gaussian processes, hidden Markov models, particle filtering (numerical methods), power system measurement, smart meters, household power demand, factorial hidden Markov model, nonGaussian disturbed problem, nonlinear disturbed problem, PF, NILM approach, sensor, household power consumption, appliance identification, NILM, disaggregated appliance power extraction, smart meter power draw, smart home, energy efficiency, smart grid, fine-grained energy data, particle filtering, online load disaggregation, PALDi:, Home appliances, Hidden Markov models, Load modeling, Power demand, Approximation methods, Computational modeling, Measurement, Factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM), hidden Markov model (HMM), load disaggregation, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), particle filter (PF), state estimation, Factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM), hidden Markov model (HMM), load disaggregation, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), particle filter (PF), state estimation",paldi online load disaggregation via particle filtering smart metering and fine grained energy data are one of the major enablers for future smart grid and improved energy efficiency in smart homes using the information provided by smart meter power draw valuable information can be extracted as disaggregated appliance power draws by non intrusive load monitoring nilm nilm allows to identify appliances according to their power characteristics in the total power consumption of a household measured by one sensor the smart meter in this paper we present an nilm approach where the appliance states are estimated by particle filtering pf pf is used for nonlinear and non gaussian disturbed problems and is suitable to estimate the appliance state on off appliances multistate appliances or combinations of them are modeled by hidden markov models and their combinations result in a factorial hidden markov model modeling the household power demand we evaluate the pf based nilm approach on synthetic and on real data from a well known dataset to show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 90 on real household power draws domestic appliances gaussian processes hidden markov models particle filtering numerical methods power system measurement smart meters household power demand factorial hidden markov model nongaussian disturbed problem nonlinear disturbed problem pf nilm approach sensor household power consumption appliance identification nilm disaggregated appliance power extraction smart meter power draw smart home energy efficiency smart grid fine grained energy data particle filtering online load disaggregation paldi home appliances hidden markov models load modeling power demand approximation methods computational modeling measurement factorial hidden markov model fhmm hidden markov model hmm load disaggregation non intrusive load monitoring nilm particle filter pf state estimation factorial hidden markov model fhmm hidden markov model hmm load disaggregation non intrusive load monitoring nilm particle filter pf state estimation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
796,0,"Seamlessly interconnecting legacy IEEE 1394 devices over WiMedia UWB network: the mirroring bridge Bridging IEEE 1394 buses is becoming important since it can be used to provide wireless connectivity among 1394 devices. Unfortunately, existing bridge mechanisms, such as the IEEE 1394.1 bridge and the transparent bridge, have practical limitations. The former does not support interoperability with legacy 1394 devices and the latter requires a new hardware chipset for bridge implementation. We thus propose a new bridge mechanism called a mirroring bridge to overcome these limitations. It supports interoperability with legacy 1394 devices by emulating remote nodes inside a bridge and via packet address translation that can be implemented through software. We have implemented the proposed bridge mechanism and have succeeded in interconnecting legacy 1394 devices over an experimental WiMedia UWB network. The experimental result showed that the average throughput of the mirroring bridge is 188.7 Mbps, which is 94.4% of the maximum throughput of the UWB chipset used.

797,0,"Improving ZigBee Device Network Authentication Using Ensemble Decision Tree Classifiers With Radio Frequency Distinct Native Attribute Fingerprinting The popularity of ZigBee devices continues to grow in home automation, transportation, traffic management, and Industrial Control System (ICS) applications given their low-cost and low-power. However, the decentralized architecture of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for network intrusion detection and prevention. In the past, ZigBee device authentication reliability was enhanced by Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting using a Fisher-based Multiple Discriminant Analysis and Maximum Likelihood (MDA-ML) classification process to distinguish between devices in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. However, MDA-ML performance inherently degrades when RF-DNA features do not satisfy Gaussian normality conditions, which often occurs in real-world scenarios where radio frequency (RF) multipath and interference from other devices is present. We introduce non-parametric Random Forest (RndF) and Multi-Class AdaBoost (MCA) ensemble classifiers into the RF-DNA fingerprinting arena, and demonstrate improved ZigBee device authentication. Results are compared with parametric MDA-ML and Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) classifier results using identical input feature sets. Fingerprint dimensional reduction is examined using three methods, namely a pre-classification Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Test (KS-Test), a post-classification RndF feature relevance ranking, and a GRLVQI feature relevance ranking. Using the ensemble methods, an SNR=18.0 dB improvement over MDA-ML processing is realized at an arbitrary correct classification rate (%C) benchmark of %C=90%; for all SNR ∈ [0, 30] dB considered, %C improvement over MDA-ML ranged from 9% to 24%. Relative to GRLVQI processing, ensemble methods again provided improvement for all SNR, with a best improvement of %C=10% achieved at the lowest tested SNR=0.0 dB. Network penetration, measured using rogue ZigBee devices, show that at the SNR=12.0 dB (%C=90%) the ensemble methods correctly reject 31 of 36 rogue access attempts based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and an arbitrary Rogue Accept Rate of . This performance is better than MDA-ML, and GRLVQI which rejected 25/36, and 28/36 rogue access attempts respectively. The key benefit of ensemble method processing is improved rogue rejection in noisier environments; gains of 6.0 dB, and 18.0 dB are realized over GRLVQI, and MDA-ML, respectively. Collectively considering the demonstrated %C and rogue rejection capability, the use of ensemble methods improves ZigBee network authentication, and enhances anti-spoofing protection afforded by

Although efforts have been made on developing composite SOAP services, little emphasis has been put on invoking and composing a combination of SOAP, non-SOAP, and non-Web services into a composite process to execute complex tasks on various mobile devices. Main challenges are two-fold: one is how to invoke and compose heterogeneous Web services with various protocols and content types, including SOAP, RESTful, and OSGi services; and the other is how to integrate non-Web services, like Web contents and mobile applications, into a composite service process. In this work, we propose an approach to invoking and composing SOAP, non-SOAP, and non-Web services with two key features: an extended BPEL engine bundled with adapters to enable direct invocation and composition of SOAP, RESTful and OSGi services based on Adapter pattern; and two transformation mechanisms devised to enable conversion of Web contents and Android activities into OSGi services.

799,0,"Joint Scheduling of Large-Scale Appliances and Batteries Via Distributed Mixed Optimization This paper investigates joint scheduling problem of large-scale smart appliances and batteries (e.g., in a smart building), to minimize electricity payment, user's dissatisfaction and battery loss under kinds of constraints. Due to the binary nature of charge and discharge states of battery, this problem is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. In order to solve it efficiently, a distributed mixed optimization approach is proposed.

800,0,"Active Tuning of Intrinsic Camera Parameters In the last years, the research effort of the scientific community to study systems for ambient intelligence has been really strong. Usually, the systems developed so far base their analysis on images acquired by automatic cameras. In this paper, we propose a way to develop new smart systems that are able to actively decide both what to see and how to see it. In particular, the main idea is to tune the acquisition parameters on the basis of what the system desires to acquire. The regulation strategy is based on two camera parameters, focus and iris. It aims to identify an optimal sequence of steps to enhance the acquisition quality of an object of interest. To this end, a hierarchy of neural networks has been employed first to select which parameter must be regulated then to adjust it. The proposed solution can be applied to both static and moving cameras. The results show how the proposed technique can be applied to images acquired by a moving camera with zoom capabilities for surveillance purposes. cameras, image enhancement, image sensors, surveillance, intrinsic camera parameter, active tuning, regulation strategy, acquisition quality, neural network, surveillance purpose, image enhancement, Cameras, Focusing, Control systems, Image processing, Iris, Neural networks, Surveillance, Object detection, Monitoring, Computer science, Image enhancement, image processing, image sensors, video signal processing, visual system",active tuning of intrinsic camera parameters in the last years the research effort of the scientific community to study systems for ambient intelligence has been really strong usually the systems developed so far base their analysis on images acquired by automatic cameras in this paper we propose a way to develop new smart systems that are able to actively decide both what to see and how to see it in particular the main idea is to tune the acquisition parameters on the basis of what the system desires to acquire the regulation strategy is based on two camera parameters focus and iris it aims to identify an optimal sequence of steps to enhance the acquisition quality of an object of interest to this end a hierarchy of neural networks has been employed first to select which parameter must be regulated then to adjust it the proposed solution can be applied to both static and moving cameras the results show how the proposed technique can be applied to images acquired by a moving camera with zoom capabilities for surveillance purposes cameras image enhancement image sensors surveillance intrinsic camera parameter active tuning regulation strategy acquisition quality neural network surveillance purpose image enhancement cameras focusing control systems image processing iris neural networks surveillance object detection monitoring computer science image enhancement image processing image sensors video signal processing visual system,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

The protocol is especially tailored for industrial and home automation networks, and in many application contexts, it offers several advantages compared with other solutions targeted at similar purposes. RBIS has been conceived to rely on conventional Wi-Fi equipment and, in particular, on unmodified access points. It is based on the master/slave approach and follows the receiver/receiver paradigm. An implementation of RBIS-carried out completely in software and based on timestamps taken at the interrupt handler level-has been developed, which achieves a synchronization error below 3 μs. Then, a simple distributed hard real-time control application has been setup, which consists in two PCs running real-time application interface for Linux (RTAI) and connected through Wi-Fi.

Many applications of intelligent agents, such as the control of ambient intelligence environments and autonomous intelligent robotic systems, require the processing of information coming in from many available sensors to produce adequate output responses in changing scenarios. Autonomy, in these cases, applies not only to the ability of the agent to produce correct outputs without human guidance, but also to its ubiquity and/or portability, low-power consumption and integrability. In this sense, an embedded electronic system implementation paradigm can be applied to the design of autonomous intelligent agents in order to satisfy the above mentioned characteristics. However, processing complex computational intelligence algorithms with tight delay constraints in resource-constrained and low power embedded systems is a challenging engineering problem. In this paper a single-chip intelligent agent based on a computationally efficient neuro-fuzzy information processing core is described. The system has been endowed with an information preprocessing module based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that permits a substantial reduction of the input space dimensionality with little loss of modeling capability. Moreover, the PCA module has been tested as a means to achieve deep adaptability in changing environment dynamics and to endow the agent with fault tolerance in the presence of sensor failures.

Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers' data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components.

Interdisciplinary competencies from engineering, information technology, and computer science are required in order to understand and manage the diverse interrelations between physical objects and their digital counterpart. This paper proposes a system architecture for a mixed-reality based learning environment, which combines physical objects and visualization of its digital content via Augmented Reality.

This allows the applications to adapt themselves to the entities, thus avoiding to overflow them with inquires and information. The analysis of trails, the context-aware history of actions, can further improve the relevance of information. This paper proposes a model that allows applications to register entities' actions in trails and infer profile information from these trails, using semantic interoperability and thus allowing different applications to share information and infer a unified profile. An application was developed and integrated with two different softwares in a scenario of ubiquitous learning, where the student profiles were dynamically updated, allowing them to better adapt to the environment. The contributions of this model are the use of trails for extracting profiles and the capability of managing dynamic inference rules for profile generation.

Improving mobility of people through increased use of public transportation has a number of advantages since it is strategic to reduce energy consumption, to lower emissions and pollution levels, to improve public safety, and to dramatically reduce congestions and road traffic. Reducing private transportation clearly bring significant benefits not only to citizens' quality of life and public health but it also results in a more efficient urban system as a whole, with consequent substantial economic benefits at the wider societal level.

The use of computer controls removes the need to actually flick a switch and allows elements of the home to respond automatically to the people living in it. Successful control and heating ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is a primary concern in building project: in order to achieve the required comfort and energy efficiency goals, a lot of variables must be coordinated and kept at particular pre-designed operation points.

While some research has addressed the factors that influence the selection of the software acquisition method in large organisations, little is known about the factors affecting SMEs. Objective To provide an understanding of factors that affect the decision process of software acquisition for SMEs. It is expected that results from this study: (i) will assist the SME decision process for software acquisition, and (ii) will assist policy makers in terms of developing appropriate guidelines for SME software acquisition. Method A positivist research perspective has been adopted involving semi-structured interviews in eight SMEs in Thailand with the interviewees assigning to each of the potential factors. Results The study found that the following factors affect both SMEs and large organisations: requirements fit, cost, scale and complexity, commoditization/flexibility, time, in-house experts, support structure, and operational factors. Factors mainly applying to large organisations were strategic role of the software, intellectual property concerns, and risk, Factors particularly relevant to SMEs (ubiquitous systems, availability of free download, and customizable to specific government/tax regulations). Conclusion The results suggest that: (i) when deciding on their software acquisition method, SMEs are generally less likely to pursue a long-term vision compared with larger organisations, possibly because SMEs mainly serve their local markets; and (ii) contrary to the large organisations, the role that the IT plays in SMEs may not be as vital to the SMEs' core business processes, to their supply chains, and/or to the management of their customer relationship. Furthermore, neither the level of technological intensity nor size of the SME appears to affect the ranks given by the interviewees for the various factors.

817,0,"Automatic synthesis and verification of real-time embedded software for mobile and ubiquitous systems Currently available application frameworks that target the automatic design of real-time embedded software are poor in integrating functional and non-functional requirements for mobile and ubiquitous systems. In this work, we present the internal architecture and design flow of a newly proposed framework called Verifiable Embedded Real-Time Application Framework (VERTAF), which integrates three techniques namely software component-based reuse, formal synthesis, and formal verification. Component reuse is based on a formal unified modeling language (UML) real-time embedded object model. Formal synthesis employs quasi-static and quasi-dynamic scheduling with multi-layer portable efficient code generation, which can output either real-time operating systems (RTOS)-specific application code or automatically generated real-time executive with application code. Formal verification integrates a model checker kernel from state graph manipulators (SGM), by adapting it for embedded software. The proposed architecture for VERTAF is component-based which allows plug-and-play for the scheduler and the verifier. The architecture is also easily extensible because reusable hardware and software design components can be added. Application examples developed using VERTAF demonstrate significantly reduced relative design effort as compared to design without VERTAF, which also shows how high-level reuse of software components combined with automatic synthesis and verification increases design productivity.

In this article, two characteristics are added to software agents with personality: dynamic personality and the relationships of personality trait openness with both problem solving ability and cognitive complexity. The last characteristic of openness leads to its impact to dynamic modification of problem solving ability. In this article, an implementation of a fuzzy agent with personality is realized in Java environment to show personality descriptors, personality factors, personality style, and problem solving success consequently. Furthermore, a prototype system is presented to update personality facets and respective personality trait openness which can affect problem solving ability.

The message of the paper is that sustainability requires a significant input from Ergonomics/Human Factors, but the profession needs some expansion in its thinking in order to make this contribution. Creating a future sustainable world in which people experience an acceptable way of life will not happen without a large input from manufacturing industry into all the Global Drivers, both in delivering products that meet sustainability criteria (such as durability, reliability, minimised material requirement and low energy consumption), and in developing sustainable processes to deliver products for sustainability (such as minimum waste, minimum emissions and low energy consumption).

This is especially true for safety- and time-critical applications where rigorous requalification processes are necessary after a software change. A theoretical approach to incremental or modular certification would provide the ability to use particular subsystems in a modular fashion, but this requires both functional and time behaviour independence of the module.

A new functionality was added to the initial system, and later reconfigured into the FPGA-chip as a new processor-module. Different memory architectures of the multiprocessor system and their relations to the changes in temporal behaviour of the system were tested and measured.

We propose a simple Petri Net based model to study some of its main characteristics. We model both devices and software components as a special kind of coloured Petri Nets, located in locations, that can move to other locations and synchronize with other co-located nets, offering and requesting services. We obtain an amenable model for ubiquitous computing, due to its graphical representation. We present our proposal in a progressive way, first presenting a basic model where coordination is formalized by the synchronized firing of pairs of compatible transitions that offer and request a specific service, and ad hoc networks are modeled by constraining mobility by the dynamic acquisition of locality names.

The approach presented in this paper elucidates the development of rule-based BIM objects which allows a designer to create building models within the rules of Modular Coordination (MC). With this development, a designer will be able to use MC standards to size and locate building objects in a modular reference frame. Integration of rules of MC with BIM authoring tool will enhance the design process and allow designers to automate some complex modelling/documentation activities requiring no design expertise.

835,0,"Software contributions to aircraft adverse events: Case studies and analyses of recurrent accident patterns and failure mechanisms Software is central to aircraft flight operation, and by the same token it is playing an increasing role in aircraft incidents and accidents. Software related errors have distinctive failure mechanisms, and their contributions to aircraft accident sequences are not properly understood or captured by traditional risk analysis techniques. To better understand these mechanisms, we analyze in this work five recent aircraft accidents and incidents involving software. For each case, we identify the role of software and analyze its contributions to the sequence of events leading to the accident. We adopt a visualization tool based on the Sequential Timed Event Plotting (STEP) methodology to highlight the software's interaction with sensors and other aircraft subsystems, and its contributions to the incident/accident. The case studies enable an in-depth analysis of recurrent failure mechanisms and provide insight into the causal chain and patterns through which software contributes to adverse events. For example, the case studies illustrate how software related failures can be context- or situation-dependent, situations that may have been overlooked during software verification and validation or testing. The case studies also identify the critical role of flawed sensor inputs as a key determinant or trigger of ``dormant'' software defects. In some cases, we find that software features put in place to address certain risks under nominal operating conditions are the ones that lead or contribute to accidents under off-nominal or unconsidered conditions. The case studies also demonstrate that the software may be complying with its requirements but still place the aircraft in a hazardous state or contribute to an adverse event. This result challenges the traditional notion, articulated in most standards, of software failure as non-compliance with requirements, and it invites a careful re-thinking of this and related concepts.

836,0,"Surrogate modeling for the fast optimization of energy systems While software simulations in the building technology field are essential for designing efficient systems, for specific applications, the tools currently available are computationally too expensive. This paper presents a novel approach for the fast computation of accurate simulation results and demonstrates its efficacy for solving a multiobjective optimization problem. A surrogate modeling approach is proposed, which is based on an effective interpolation algorithm and an optimal distribution of sampling nodes. The highest accuracy is shown to be achieved by a Poisson disk node distribution and an interpolation function developed from a cubic radial basis function. Furthermore, since global interpolation algorithms in high-dimensional spaces are fundamentally inefficient, a local adaptation is developed. The fidelity of the surrogate model is shown to generalize to higher dimensions with respect to the average number of nodes per dimension ηs. The application potential is tested on a case study consisting of a multiobjective design optimization problem. The results show that the surrogate and the fine model converge to the same solution. Being 150 times faster than the original model, the surrogate model is thus a valid choice for computationally demanding applications.

Thus it is being widely used as a test tool for software products requiring high reliability such as mission critical cyber-physical systems. However, existing virtualization platforms do not fully virtualize the battery subsystem. Therefore, it is difficult to test battery-related features of guest systems. In this paper, we propose Virtual Battery, a battery virtualization scheme for type II full virtualization platforms. Virtual Battery takes the form of an ACPI-compatible battery device driver dedicated to each virtual machine, which virtualizes a target system. Through Virtual Battery, developers can easily manipulate the charging and battery status of each virtual machine (VM), regardless of the existence or current status of the host system's battery.

However, time-consuming and labor-intensive works hamper the development of smart building applications. Therefore, application developers need the proper software platforms to efficiently design the applications. Much research currently proposed the design approaches based on low-level concerns and the real-world deployments based on high-level programming abstraction are rare. Accordingly, the pressing issue is how to offer the easy-to-use tools with acceptable performance to rapidly and easily design the application scenarios for non-technical application users. Therefore, this study focuses on the application-layer simulation to propose a Visualization System of Context-aware Application Scenario Planning (VS-CaSP) for assisting non-technical developers and end-users in rapidly and easily designing the application scenario of smart buildings and in performing the acceptable and predictable simulation and evaluation.

863,0,"Methods for model-based reasoning within agent-based Ambient Intelligence applications Within agent-based Ambient Intelligence applications agents react to humans based on information obtained by sensoring and their knowledge about human functioning. Appropriate types of reactions depend on the extent to which an agent understands the human and is able to interpret the available information (which is often incomplete, and hence multi-interpretable) in order to create a more complete internal image of the environment, including humans. Such an understanding requires that the agent has knowledge to a certain depth about the human's physiological and mental processes in the form of an explicitly represented model of the causal and dynamic relations describing these processes. In addition, given such a model representation, the agent needs reasoning methods to derive conclusions from the model and interpret the (partial) information available by sensoring. This paper presents the development of a toolbox that can be used by a modeller to design Ambient Intelligence applications. This toolbox contains a number of model-based reasoning methods and approaches to control such reasoning methods. Formal specifications in an executable temporal format are offered, which allows for simulation of reasoning processes and automated verification of the resulting reasoning traces in a dedicated software environment. A number of such simulation experiments and their formal analysis are described.

The purpose of this research was to quantify the negative environmental impacts of SHA and balance them with their benefits. The evaluation of SHA has been done by conducting a generic Life cycle assessment study using SimaPro programme and the EcoInvent database. The LCA study concluded that the largest environmental impact of HEMS is the use-phase electricity consumption of home automation devices. The paper concludes that the energy payback time of home automation in term of the electricity consumption of the devices is negative by 1.6 years. The largest part of this is due to the energy consumption of smart plugs.

Suitable simulation and emulation approaches and tools must be adopted to allow designers to experiment with their ideas and to incrementally verify designed policies in a scenario where the environment is partly emulated and partly composed of real devices.

They should not be conscious of how these features are implemented, from a hardware or from a software point of view. In order to obtain such a high degree of transparency, it is necessary for the system to be able to provide its services regardless of location, adapting to the environment and the context in general and to the available hardware more specifically. This is known as ubiquity, and to achieve it requires considering many aspects, from security and privacy to system interoperability. This paper is mainly focused on the development of two elements related to ubiquity: physical migration of components between different platforms together with their associated runtime state, and the adaptation of those components to the destination platform and physical environment.

Cultural inertia pushes back on the reality that products need to be rapidly developed and produced at lower costs in order to be competitive. Aircraft manufacturers have had some success using model-based design and computer simulations to eliminate prototyping, but cyber physical weapon development is still highly dependent on past engineering experience and the development of working prototypes. This paper discusses how a model-based, information-centric environment can accelerate the design of new systems. Central to this paradigm shift is the introduction of information models to complement product models. The overall goal of information-centric product development is the reduction of the traditional engineering semi-sequential process and an over-reliance on extremely precise requirements and risk mediation.

908,0,"WSN in cyber physical systems: Enhanced energy management routing approach using software agents Recently, the cyber physical system has emerged as a promising direction to enrich the interactions between physical and virtual worlds. Meanwhile, a lot of research is dedicated to wireless sensor networks as an integral part of cyber physical systems. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of spatially distributed autonomous devices that use sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions. These autonomous devices, or nodes, combine with routers and a gateway to create a typical WSN system. Shrinking size and increasing deployment density of wireless sensor nodes implies the smaller equipped battery size. This means emerging wireless sensor nodes must compete for efficient energy utilization to increase the WSN lifetime. The network lifetime is defined as the time duration until the first sensor node in a network fails due to battery depletion. One solution for enhancing the lifetime of WSN is to utilize mobile agents. In this paper, we propose an agent-based approach that performs data processing and data aggregation decisions locally i.e., at nodes rather than bringing data back to a central processor (sink). Our proposed approach increases the network lifetime by generating an optimal routing path for mobile agents to transverse the network. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In the first phase, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to generate a complete graph to connect all source nodes in a WSN. In the second phase, a genetic algorithm is used to generate the best-approximated route for mobile agents in a radio harsh environment to route the sensory data to the base-station. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, a formal analysis and experimental results are presented.

909,0,"Semantics to the Shop Floor: Towards Ontology Modularization and Reuse in the Automation Domain The traditional way of engineering production systems requires static information flows within and in between automation software, from field control software to manufacturing operations management. The common understanding of data and its containing information is realized by implicit assumptions on data semantics. In contrast, the vision of future production systems as cyber-physical systems (CPS) focuses on intelligent production facilities, which are characterized by autonomous behavior and dynamic, cooperative interactions. As a consequence, data and information that are stored and exchanged within CPS cannot rely on the assumption that other software systems are aware of data semantics. A means to solve this issue is ontologies -- an approach being intensely discussed and applied for enhancing data with semantics. However, reuse of ontologies within the automation domain is hampered as ontologies are developed for specific use cases without having reusability in mind. In this paper, these drawbacks of ontology development are discussed and an approach for maximizing reusability through modularizing ontologies for different fields of the automation domain is presented.

However, in a low precision implementation, constraint satisfaction is not guaranteed if infinite precision is assumed during the algorithm design. To enforce constraint satisfaction under numerical errors, we use forward error analysis to compute an error bound on the output of the embedded controller. We treat this error as a state disturbance and use this to inform the design of a constraint-tightening robust controller.

Current research highlights the underlying technical challenges but lacks a well-founded conceptualization for CPS that reflects its character as a software-enabled hybrid solution, consisting of software as well as of service and tangible product parts. The latter may facilitate research on CPS from a business-oriented and a customer value creation perspective rather than solely from a technical perspective. For this purpose, the present contribution proposes the conceptualization of the industrial software-product-service system.

Currently no general frameworks are available to bridge the concept-code gap rampant in design and development of complex, software-intensive mechatronic systems called cyber-physical systems. To fill this gap and provide an alternative approach to Object Management Group's UML/SysML/OCL combination, we propose: Bond Graph based Unified Meta-Modeling Framework (BG-UMF). BG-UMF is a practical and viable alternative and uses a novel hybrid approach based on model unification and integration.

917,0,"A cyber--physical system-based approach for industrial automation systems Industrial automation systems (IASs) are commonly developed using the languages defined by the IEC 61131 standard and are executed on programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Their software part is commonly considered only after the development and integration of mechanics and electronics. However, this approach narrows the solution space for software; thus, it is considered inadequate to address the complexity of today's systems. In this paper, we adopt a system-based approach for the development of IASs. Based on this, the UML model of the software part of the system is extracted from the SysML system model and it is then refined to get the implementation code. Two implementation alternatives are considered to exploit both PLCs and the recent deluge of embedded boards in the market. For PLC targets, the new version of IEC 61131 that supports object-orientation is adopted, while Java is used for embedded boards.

To assure correctness of functionality with respect to requirements, there is a strong need for methods of analysis that can describe system behavior in terms of time, intervals of time, and relationships among intervals of time. Accordingly, this paper discusses temporal semantics and their central role in the development of a new time-based reasoning framework in MBSE for CPS. Three independent but integrated modules compose the system: CPS, ontology and time-reasoning modules. This approach is shown to be mostly appropriate for CPS for which safety and performance are dependent on the correct time- based prediction of the future state of the system.

Businesses can benefit from the integration of these real-world data; new services can be provided to customers, or existing business processes can be improved. Events are a well-known concept in business processes. However, there is no appropriate abstraction mechanism to encapsulate event stream processing in units that represent business functions in a coherent manner across the process modeling, process execution, and IT infrastructure layer. In this paper we present Event Stream Processing Units (SPUs) as such an abstraction mechanism. SPUs encapsulate application logic for event stream processing and enable a seamless transition between process models, executable process representations, and components at the IT layer. We derive requirements for SPUs and introduce EPC and BPMN extensions to model SPUs at the abstract and at the technical process layer. We introduce a transformation from SPUs in EPCs to SPUs in BPMN and implement our modeling notation extensions in Software AG ARIS.

926,0,"Specifying software features for composition: A tool-supported approach Development of several computing and communication technologies is enabling the widespread availability of pervasive systems. In smart home applications, household appliances---such as security alarms, heating systems, doors and windows---are connected to home digital networks. These applications offer features that are typically developed by disparate vendors, and when composed together, these features are expected to work together harmoniously. Engineering these systems poses two main challenges. The first challenge is: how can developers of individual features specify the features in order to make them composable with other hitherto unknown features? The second challenge is: when composition of features does not produce the desired behaviour, what can be done to resolve this non-intrusively? This article argues that the two issues are intrinsically related, and proposes an approach that addresses the first challenge in a way that makes the second challenge manageable. In particular, we describe a way of writing feature specifications in which assumptions about the problem world are made explicit.

930,0,"Simulation alternatives for the verification of networked cyber-physical systems Several embedded system applications are used to control physical processes thus leading to the concept of Cyber-Physical System. Sensing, computation and actuation are combined by involving a set of highly heterogeneous components, i.e., digital and analog hardware, software, energy sources, and external physical systems (e.g., a room to be heated, a mechanical component). Moreover, we see the growing use of networks to connect several sub-systems in a more efficient way; this contributes to introduce a further level of heterogeneity due to the presence of messages exchanged over communication channels. All these aspects should be taken into account in the design process to find highly optimized solutions; in particular, simulation is a key technique for their verification. However, the heterogeneity of components, together with the presence of the network, forces to adopt complex and slow co-simulation techniques to carry on the simulation of the entire system. This work aims at proposing SystemC as unified framework to model and simulate Networked Cyber-Physical Systems. Concerning the modeling of continuous-time components and a specific class of discrete-time components, the different Models of Computation provided by the Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) extension of SystemC are used. Regarding the network, SystemC and the SystemC Network Simulation Library are used to model communications at different abstraction levels. The approach is validated by considering a networked control system. First, the accuracy and speed of SystemC simulation is compared to Matlab/Simulink simulation. Second, different simulation alternatives are compared to co-simulation.

934,1,"Architectural evolution of FamiWare using cardinality-based feature models Context Ambient Intelligence systems domain is an outstanding example of modern systems that are in permanent evolution, as new devices, technologies or facilities are continuously appearing. This means it would be desirable to have a mechanism that helps with the propagation of evolution changes in deployed systems. Objective We present a software product line engineering process to manage the evolution of FamiWare, a family of middleware for ambient intelligence environments. This process drives the evolution of FamiWare middleware configurations using cardinality-based feature models, which are especially well suited to express the structural variability of ambient intelligence systems. Method FamiWare uses cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model the structural variability present in ambient intelligence systems, composed of a large variety of heterogeneous devices. Since the management evolution of configurations with clonable features is manually untreatable due to the high number of features, our process automates it and propagates changes made at feature level to the architectural components of the FamiWare middleware. This is a model driven development process as the evolution management, the propagation of evolution changes and the code generation are performed using some kind of model mappings and transformations. Concretely we present a variability modelling language to map the selection of features to the corresponding FamiWare middleware architectural components. Results Our process is able to manage the evolution of cardinality-based feature models with thousands of features, something which is not possible to tackle manually. Thanks to the use of the variability language and the automatic code generation it is possible to propagate and maintain a correspondence between the FamiWare architectural model and the code. The process is then able to calculate the architectural differences between the evolved configuration and the previous one. Checking these differences, our process helps to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To perform those tasks we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two feature model configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one. Conclusion Our process automatically propagates the evolution changes of the middleware family into the existing configurations where the middleware is already deployed and also helps us to calculate the effort in performing the changes in every configuration. Finally, we validated our approach, demonstrating the functioning of the defined operators and showing that by using our tool we can generate evolved configurations for FamiWare with thousands of cloned features, for several case studies.

936,1,"Transforming and tracing reused requirements models to home automation models Context Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) has emerged as a very promising approach to cope with the inherent complexity of modern software-based systems. Furthermore, it is well known that the Requirements Engineering (RE) stage is critical for a project's success. Despite the importance of RE, MDSD approaches commonly leave textual requirements specifications to one side. Objective Our aim is to integrate textual requirements specifications into the MDSD approach by using the MDSD techniques themselves, including metamodelling and model transformations. The proposal is based on the assumption that a reuse-based Model-Driven Requirements Engineering (MDRE) approach will improve the requirements engineering stage, the quality of the development models generated from requirements models, and will enable the traces from requirements to other development concepts (such as analysis or design) to be maintained. Method The approach revolves around the Requirements Engineering Metamodel, denominated as REMM, which supports the definition of the boilerplate based textual requirements specification languages needed for the definition of model transformation from application requirements models to platform-specific application models and code. Results The approach has been evaluated through its application to Home Automation (HA) systems. The HA Requirement Specification Language denominated as HAREL is used to define application requirements models which will be automatically transformed and traced to the application model conforming to the HA Domain Specific Language. Conclusions An anonymous online survey has been conducted to evaluate the degree of acceptance by both HA application developers and MDSD practitioners. The main conclusion is that 66.7% of the HA experts polled strongly agree that the automatic transformation of the requirements models to HA models improves the quality of the HA models.

In particular, the user human interaction in embedded systems and cyber-physical systems is a critical design challenge. GUI improves user experience for untrained users but, at the same time, brings great challenges to software testing. In 2002, Memon reported that up to 60% of the software testing are conducted against user interface. In the last decade, many automatic GUI testing approaches are proposed to address this challenge. In particular, model-based GUI testing mechanisms generate testing cases according to state transition diagram and software model. In this paper, we present the design and implementation for a user behavior augmented GUI test case generation mechanism. We define User Computer Interaction Hidden Markov Model (UCIHMM) to model user behaviors.

STSs are heterogeneous, dynamic, unpredictable, and weakly controllable. Their operational environment changes unexpectedly, actors join and leave the system at will, actors fail to meet their objectives and under-perform, and dependencies on other actors are violated. To deal with such situations, we propose an architecture for STSs that makes an STS self-reconfigurable, i.e., capable of switching autonomously from one configuration to a better one. Our architecture performs a Monitor-Diagnose-Reconcile-Compensate cycle: it monitors actor behaviors and context changes, diagnoses failures and under-performance by checking whether monitored behavior is compliant with actors goals, finds a possible way to address the problem, and enacts compensation actions to reconcile actual and desired behavior. Compensation actions take into account the autonomy of participants in an STS, which cannot be controlled. Our architecture is requirements driven: we use extended Tropos goal models to diagnose failures as well as to identify alternative strategies to meet requirements. After presenting our conceptual architecture and the algorithms, it is founded upon; we describe a prototype implementation applied to a case study concerning smart-homes.

In this context, achieving interoperability among heterogeneous NSs represents an important issue. In order to mediate the NSs interaction protocol and solve possible mismatches, connectors are often built. However, connector development is a never-ending and error-prone task and prevents the eternality of NSs. For this reason, in the literature, many approaches propose the automatic synthesis of connectors. However, solving the connector synthesis problem in general is hard and, when possible, it results in a monolithic connector hence preventing its evolution. In this paper, we define a method for the automatic synthesis of modular connectors, each of them expressed as the composition of independent mediators. A modular connector, as synthesized by our method, supports connector evolution and performs correct mediation.

However, traditional requirements elicitation methods do not sufficiently account for contextual factors and therefore cannot be used effectively to represent and analyse the privacy requirements of mobile end users. On the other hand, methods that do investigate contextual factors tend to produce data that does not lend itself to the process of requirements extraction.

From a Software Engineering point of view this development scenario brings new challenges in tailoring or building software processes, impacting current software technologies. However, it has not yet been explicitly shown how to characterize a software project with the perception of ubiquitous computing. Objective This paper presents a conceptual framework to support the characterization of ubiquitous software projects according to their ubiquity adherence level. It also intends to apply such characterization approach to some projects, aiming at observing their adherence with ubiquitous computing principles. Method To follow a research strategy based on systematic reviews and surveys to acquire UbiComp knowledge and organize a conceptual framework regarding ubiquitous computing, which can be used to characterize UbiComp software projects. Besides, to demonstrate its application by characterizing some software projects. Results Ubiquitous computing encapsulates at least 11 different high abstraction level characteristics represented by 123 functional and 45 restrictive factors. Based on this a checklist was organized to allow the characterization of ubiquitous software projects, which has been applied on 26 ubiquitous software projects from four different application domains (ambient intelligence, pervasive healthcare, U-learning, and urban space). No project demonstrated to support more than 65% of the characteristics set. Service omnipresence was observed in all of these projects. However, some characteristics, although identified as necessary in the checklist, were not identified in any of them. Conclusion There are characteristics that identify a software project as ubiquitous. However, a ubiquitous software project does not necessarily have to implement all of them. The application domain can influence the appearing of UbiComp characteristics in software projects, promoting an increase of their adherence to UbiComp and, thus, for additional software technologies to deal with these ubiquitous requirements.

947,1,"Proactive and Reactive Runtime Service Discovery: A Framework and Its Evaluation The identification of services during the execution of service-based applications to replace services in them that are no longer available and/or fail to satisfy certain requirements is an important issue. In this paper, we present a framework to support runtime service discovery. This framework can execute service discovery queries in pull and push mode. In pull mode, it executes queries when a need for finding a replacement service arises. In push mode, queries are subscribed to the framework to be executed proactively and, in parallel with the operation of the application, to identify adequate services that could be used if the need for replacing a service arises. Hence, the proactive (push) mode of query execution makes it more likely to avoid interruptions in the operation of service-based applications when a service in them needs to be replaced at runtime. In both modes of query execution, the identification of services relies on distance-based matching of structural, behavioral, quality, and contextual characteristics of services and applications.

While existing literature on trust originating in computer science mostly revolves around aspects of information security, authentication, etc., research on trust in automation---originating from behavioral sciences---almost exclusively focuses on the sociotechnical context in which applications are embedded. The behavioral theory of trust in automation aims at explaining the formation of trust, helping to identify countermeasures for users' uncertainties that lead to lessened trust in an application. We hence propose an approach to augment the system development process of ubiquitous systems with insights into behavioral trust theory. Our approach enables developers to derive design elements that help foster trust in their application by performing four key activities: identifying users' uncertainties, linking them to trust antecedents from theory, deducting functional requirements and finally designing trust-supporting design elements (TSDEs). Evaluating user feedback on two recommender system prototypes, gathered in a study with over 160 participants, we show that by following our process, we were able to derive four TSDEs that helped to significantly increase the users' trust in the system.

These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery power, connectivity, reachability of services and hosts, etc. In this paper, we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice.

Mobile applications can leverage on the benefits of adaptive computing to optimize the QoS delivery based on contextual situations. Fuzzy control models have been successfully applied to various distributed network QoS management systems. However, existing models are either application-specific or limited to abstract modeling and simple conceptual scenarios which do not take into account overall model scalability. Specifically, the large number of QoS parameters in a mobile operating environment causes an exponential increase in the number of rules correspondingly increases the demand for processing power to infer the rules. Hierarchical fuzzy systems were introduced to reduce the number of rules using hierarchical fuzzy control, in which correlated linguistic variables are hierarchically inferred and grouped into abstract linguistic variables.

In this paper, an adaptation framework to facilitate adaptation with multiple concerns by using reusable and composable adaptation modules is proposed. Rather than using one‐size‐fits‐all approach, in this framework, system global adaptation behavior is generated by contextually fusing adaptation plans from multiple adaptation modules. In order to handle possible conflicts from multiple adaptation plans, supports for conflict detection and resolution are provided. Following the framework design principles, a supporting middleware is implemented based on the service‐oriented component model. Adaptation behaviors are realized as individually deployable adaptation components. A strategy called normalized context matching degree is proposed to rate and select applicable adaptation components. Possible conflicts in dealing with multiple adaptation concerns are resolved by using the semantics of actuators and context conditions.

960,1,"Reasoning with contextual requirements: Detecting inconsistency and conflicts Context The environment in which the system operates, its context, is variable. The autonomous ability of a software to adapt to context has to be planned since the requirements analysis stage as a strong mutual influence between requirements and context does exist. On the one hand, context is a main factor to decide whether to activate a requirement, the applicable alternatives to meet an activated requirement as well as their qualities. On the other hand, the system actions to reach requirements could cause changes in the context. Objectives Modelling the relationship between requirements and context is a complex task and developing error-free models is hard to achieve without an automated support. The main objective of this paper is to develop a set of automated analysis mechanisms to support the requirements engineers to detect and analyze modelling errors in contextual requirements models. Method We study the analysis of the contextual goal model which is a requirements model that weaves together the variability of both context and requirements. Goal models are used during the early stages of software development and, thus, our analysis detects errors early in the development process. We develop two analysis mechanisms to detect two kinds of modelling errors. The first mechanism concerns the detection of inconsistent specification of contexts in a goal model. The second concerns the detection of conflicting context changes that arise as a consequence of the actions performed by the system to meet different requirements simultaneously. We support our analysis with a CASE tool and provide a systematic process that guides the construction and analysis of contextual goal models. We illustrate and evaluate our framework via a case study on a smart-home system for supporting the life of people having dementia problems. Results The evaluation showed a significant ability of our analysis mechanisms to detect errors which were not notable by requirements engineers. Moreover, the evaluation showed acceptable performance of these mechanisms when processing up to medium-sized contextual goal models. The modelling constructs which we proposed as an input to enable the analysis were found easy to understand and capture. Conclusions Our developed analysis for the detection of inconsistency and conflicts in contextual goal models is an essential step for the entire system correctness. It avoids us developing unusable and unwanted functionalities and functionalities which lead to conflicts when they operate together. Further research to improve our analysis to scale with large-sized models and to consider other kinds of errors is still needed.

The adaptation can be faulty if the contexts are subject to inconsistency. Various techniques have been proposed to identify key contexts from inconsistencies. By removing these contexts, an application is expected to run with inconsistencies resolved. However, existing practice largely overlooks an application's internal requirements on using these contexts for adaptation. It may lead to unexpected side effect from inconsistency resolution. This paper studies a novel way of resolving context inconsistency with the aim of minimizing such side effect for an application. We model and analyze the side effect for rule-based ubiquitous applications, and experimentally measure and compare it for various inconsistency resolution strategies.

971,1,"A framework for utilizing qualitative spatial relations between networked embedded systems With more and more everyday artifacts being equipped with networked embedded systems technology, their spatial situation or context--such as where they are located or whether two of them are near or far apart from each other--is becoming increasingly relevant. The emerging availability of sensor technologies for measuring properties of the physical space enables them to become aware of their spatial context and adapt to changes accordingly, which in turn contributes to the implementation of systems that operate autonomously in the background and interact with humans in a more unobtrusive way. In this article, we specifically address the use of spatial relations between technology-rich artifacts as well as their changes over time. A key aspect is the abstraction of spatial contexts in order to separate details which are not relevant for a certain application, and thereby save computational resources or provide spatial information in a way that is closer to human concepts of space. In this regard, our focus is on qualitatively represented spatial relations, which are used as the basic building blocks for the development of spatially aware applications.

In this vision, a milkbox left on the table after the user has left the home could ask the service of a mobile robot to be placed back in the refrigerator. A missing ingredient to realize this vision is a mechanism that enables the communication and interoperation among such highly heterogeneous entities. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism in the form of a middleware able to integrate robots, tiny devices and augmented everyday objects into one and the same system.

973,1,"Efficient Resource-Aware Hybrid Configuration of Distributed Pervasive Applications As the size and complexity of Pervasive Computing environments increases, configuration and adaptation of distributed applications gains importance. These tasks require automated system support, since users must not be distracted by the (re-)composition of applications. In homogeneous ad hoc scenarios, relying on decentralized configuration schemes is obviously mandatory, while centralized approaches may help to reduce latencies in weakly heterogeneous infrastructure-based environments. However, in case of strongly heterogeneous pervasive environments including several resource-rich and resource-weak devices, both approaches may lead to suboptimal results concerning configuration latencies: While the resource-weak devices represent bottlenecks for decentralized configuration, the centralized approach faces the problem of not utilizing parallelism. Instead, a hybrid approach that involves only the subset of resource-rich devices is capable of rendering configuration and adaptation processes more efficiently. In this paper, we present such a resource-aware hybrid scheme that effectively reduces the time required for configuration processes. This is accomplished by a balanced-load clustering scheme that exploits the computational power of resource-rich devices, while avoiding bottlenecks in (re-)configurations. We present real-world evaluations which confirm that our approach reduces configuration latencies in heterogeneous environments by more than 30% compared to totally centralized and totally decentralized approaches.

Accordingly, current uses of context are limited to individual domains/organizations and do not provide a programmable mechanism for rapid creation of context-aware services.

981,1,"Improving the Effectiveness of Testing Pervasive Software via Context Diversity Context-aware pervasive software is responsive to various contexts and their changes. A faulty implementation of the context-aware features may lead to unpredictable behavior with adverse effects. In software testing, one of the most important research issues is to determine the sufficiency of a test suite to verify the software under test. Existing adequacy criteria for testing traditional software, however, have not explored the dimension of serial test inputs and have not considered context changes when constructing test suites. In this article, we define the concept of context diversity to capture the extent of context changes in serial inputs and propose three strategies to study how context diversity may improve the effectiveness of the data-flow testing criteria. Our case study shows that the strategy that uses test cases with higher context diversity can significantly improve the effectiveness of existing data-flow testing criteria for context-aware pervasive software. In addition, test suites with higher context diversity are found to execute significantly longer paths, which may provide a clue that reveals why context diversity can contribute to the improvement of effectiveness of test suites. test adequacy,  Context-aware program,  context diversity",improving the effectiveness of testing pervasive software via context diversity context aware pervasive software is responsive to various contexts and their changes a faulty implementation of the context aware features may lead to unpredictable behavior with adverse effects in software testing one of the most important research issues is to determine the sufficiency of a test suite to verify the software under test existing adequacy criteria for testing traditional software however have not explored the dimension of serial test inputs and have not considered context changes when constructing test suites in this article we define the concept of context diversity to capture the extent of context changes in serial inputs and propose three strategies to study how context diversity may improve the effectiveness of the data flow testing criteria our case study shows that the strategy that uses test cases with higher context diversity can significantly improve the effectiveness of existing data flow testing criteria for context aware pervasive software in addition test suites with higher context diversity are found to execute significantly longer paths which may provide a clue that reveals why context diversity can contribute to the improvement of effectiveness of test suites test adequacy context aware program context diversity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0
982,1,"Engineering pervasive service ecosystems: the sapere approach Emerging pervasive computing services will typically involve a large number of devices and service components cooperating together in an open and dynamic environment. This calls for suitable models and infrastructures promoting spontaneous, situated, and self-adaptive interactions between components. SAPERE (Self-Aware Pervasive Service Ecosystems) is a general coordination framework aimed at facilitating the decentralized and situated execution of self-organizing and self-adaptive pervasive computing services. SAPERE adopts a nature-inspired approach, in which pervasive services are modeled and deployed as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services and devices, all of which interact in accord to a limited set of coordination laws, or eco-laws. In this article, we present the overall rationale underlying SAPERE and its reference architecture. We introduce the eco-laws--based coordination model and show how it can be used to express and easily enforce general-purpose self-organizing coordination patterns.

Simplex architecture is shown to be an efficient tool to address the software failure in such systems. However, when physical failures also appear, Simplex does not work any more because the physical dynamics change due to physical failures. The Simplex architecture designed for the original physical model may not be suitable for the new dynamics. To address both software and physical failures, this paper presents the L1Simplex architecture, which contains the safety monitor, the high-performance controller (HPC), the L1-based high-assurance controller (HAC), and the decision logic for controller switching. The safety monitor is used to monitor the system behavior. It leads to another controller switching rule besides the stability-envelope-based rule in the decision logic.

984,1,"Sandboxing Controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems Cyber-physical systems bridge the gap between cyber components, typically written in software, and the physical world. Software written with traditional development practices, however, likely contains bugs or unintended interactions among components, which can result in uncontrolled and possibly disastrous physical-world interactions. Complete verification of cyber-physical systems, however, is often impractical due to outsourced development of software, cost, software created without formal models, or excessively large or complex models where the verification process becomes intractable. Rather than mandating complete modeling and verification, we advocate sandboxing of unverified cyber-physical system controllers by augmenting the system with a verified safety wrapper that can take control of the plant in order to avoid violations of formal safety properties. The focus of this work is an automatic method, based on reach ability and time-bounded reach ability of hybrid systems, to generate verified sandboxes. The method is shown to be both more general than previous work, and allows the trade-off of increased computation time for improved reach ability accuracy.

985,1,"The DigiHome Service-Oriented Platform SUMMARY Nowadays, the computational devices are everywhere. In malls, offices, streets, cars, and even homes, we can find devices providing and consuming functionality to improve the user satisfaction. These devices include sensors that provide information about the environment state (e.g., temperature, occupancy, light levels), service providers (e.g., Internet TVs, GPS), smartphones (that contain user preferences), and actuators that act on the environment (e.g., closing the blinds, activating the alarm, changing the temperature). Although these devices exhibit communication capabilities, their integration into a larger monitoring system remains a challenging task, partly because of the strong heterogeneity of technologies and protocols. Therefore, in this article, we focus on home environments and propose a middleware solution, called DigiHome, that applies the Service Component Architecture (SCA) component model to integrate data and events generated by heterogeneous devices in this kind of environments. DigiHome exploits the SCA extensibility to incorporate the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and, in this way, leverages on the integration of multiscale systems‐of‐systems (from wireless sensor networks to the Internet). Additionally, the platform applies Complex Event Processing technology that detects application‐specific situations. We claim that the modularization of concerns fostered by DigiHome and materialized in a service‐oriented architecture, makes it easier to incorporate new services and devices in smart home environments. The benefits of the DigiHome platform are demonstrated on smart home scenarios covering home automation, emergency detection, and energy saving situations.

992,1,"A design process enabling adaptation in pervasive heterogeneous contexts In the next decades, the growth in population aging will cause important problems to most industrialized countries. To tackle this issue, Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) systems can reinforce the well-being of elderly people, by providing emergency, autonomy enhancement, and comfort services. These services will postpone the need of a medicalized environment and will allow the elderly to stay longer at home. However, each elderly has specific needs and a deployment environment of such services is likely unique. Furthermore, the needs evolve over time, and so does the deployment environment of the system. In this paper, we propose the use of a model-based development method, the adaptive medium approach, to enable dynamic adaptation of AAL systems.

These networks are characterized by the volatility of their hosts and connections, which may lead to network fragmentation. Although increasingly common, they remain a challenging target for distributed applications. In this paper, we focus on component-based distributed applications by addressing the distribution and the deployment of software components on dynamic pervasive networks. We present a distribution scheme and some associated middleware mechanisms that allow a component to provide its services in an ubiquitous way.

Unlike typical adaptive middleware approaches, in which sophisticated component model semantics are embedded into an existing, underlying platform (e.g., CORBA, COM, EJB), we propose a platform that imposes minimal constraints for greater flexibility. Such a tradeoff is advantageous when the platform is targeted by automatic code generators that inherently enforce correctness by construction. Applications are written as simple, single-threaded programs that assemble and monitor a set of distributed components. The approach decomposes applications into two distinct layers: (1) a distributed network of interconnected modules performing computations, and (2) constructor logic that assembles that network via a simple block-diagram construction API. The constructor logic subsequently monitors the configured system via a stream of high-level events, such as notifications of resource availability or failures, and consequently provides a convenient, centralized location for reconfiguration and debugging. The component network is optimized for performance, while the construction API is optimized for ease of assembly. Microbenchmarks indicate that our runtime incurs minimal overhead.

The lack of a fixed infrastructure, coupled with the time-varying characteristics of the underlying network topology, makes service delivery challenging. This paper addresses these challenges and presents SARA, a unified, overlay-based service architecture to support large-scale service and application deployment in pervasive and ubiquitous environments.

To enable behavioral adaptation, a context-aware application must dynamically acquire context data from different operating spaces in the real world, such as homes, shops and persons. Motivated by the sheer number and diversity of operating spaces, we propose a scalable context data management system in this paper to facilitate data acquisition from these spaces. In our system, we design a gateway framework for all operating spaces and develop matching algorithms to integrate the local context schemas of operating spaces into a global set of domain schemas upon which SQL-based context queries can be issued from applications.

1008,1,"Formal specification and runtime detection of temporal properties for asynchronous context Formal specification and runtime detection of temporal properties for pervasive context is one of the primary approaches to achieving context-awareness. Though temporal logics have been widely used in specification of temporal properties, they are faced with severe challenges in Pervasive Computing (PvC) scenarios. First, temporal logics are traditionally defined over infinite traces of possible system behavior. However in PvC scenarios, applications observe finite prefixes of (potentially infinite) traces of environment state evolution, and adapt their behavior accordingly. Second, specification and detection of temporal properties are challenged by the intrinsic asynchrony of PvC environments. Discussions above necessitate a systematic approach to formal specification and runtime detection of temporal properties for asynchronous context. To this end, we propose CTL 3 (3-valued Computation Tree Logic), which i) adopts 3-valued semantics to capture the inconclusiveness when applications only observe finite prefixes of environment state evolution; ii) inherits the notion of branching time to capture the uncertainty resulting from the asynchrony of PvC environments. A case study is conducted to demonstrate how CTL 3 supports context-awareness in PvC scenarios. The runtime checking algorithm of CTL 3 is implemented and evaluated over MIPA - the open-source context-aware middle-ware we developed.

1009,1,"Adaptive and context-aware privacy preservation exploiting user interactions in smart environments In a pervasive system, users have very dynamic and rich interactions with the environment and its elements, including other users. To efficiently support users in such environments, a high-level representation of the system, called the context, is usually exploited. However, since pervasive environments are inherently people-centric, context might consist of sensitive information. As a consequence, privacy concerns arise, especially in terms of how to control information disclosure to other users and third parties. In this article, we propose context-aware approaches to privacy preservation in wireless and mobile pervasive environments. Specifically, we design two schemes: (i) to reduce the number of interactions between the user and the system; and (ii) to exploit the interactions between different users. Both solutions are adaptive and, thus, suitable for dynamic scenarios. In addition, our schemes require limited computational and storage resources. As a consequence, they can be easily implemented on resource-constrained personal communication and sensing devices.

SBA developers must account for uncertainty in the accuracy of context information resulting from imperfection in the sensing technology and potentially complex interactions between the sensed phenomenon, the sensor and the physical environment. To address this challenge, context simulators which generate simulated context information have been developed. A number of key challenges must be addressed before such a simulation-based SBA prototyping approach can become widely used. First, any context simulator must be flexible in its approach to simulating context so that it supports evaluating different mixes of SBAs using a selection of methods most suitable to the evaluation task at hand. Second, the context simulator must support simulating uncertainty in context as uncertainty can cause an SBA to function incorrectly. Finally, the process of setting up a simulation should be efficient in use, satisfying to the developer and also, be effective in correctly evaluating the SBA behaviour.

These kinds of problematic contexts may cause context-aware applications to behave abnormally or even fail. It is thus desirable to detect and resolve context inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to detect problematic contexts and resolve resulting context inconsistencies with the help of context-aware application semantics. By combining low-level context inconsistency resolution with high-level application error recovery, our approach can resolve the inconsistent contexts more effectively.

In distributed settings, query semantics are well-defined, for example, queries are often designed to satisfy ACID transactional properties.

In this article, we propose a query processing model for mobile ad hoc and sensor networks that is suitable for expressing a wide range of query semantics; the semantics differ in the degree of consistency with which query results reflect the state of the environment during query execution. We introduce several distinct notions of consistency and formally express them in our model. A practical and significant contribution of this article is a protocol for query processing that automatically assesses and adaptively provides an achievable degree of consistency given the operational environment throughout its execution.

1025,1,"An adaptive middleware design to support the dynamic interpretation of domain-specific models Context As the use of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) continues to gain popularity, we have developed new ways to execute DSML models. The most popular approach is to execute code resulting from a model-to-code transformation. An alternative approach is to directly execute these models using a semantic-rich execution engine -- Domain-Specific Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM includes a middleware layer responsible for the delivery of services in a given domain. Objective We will investigate an approach that performs the dynamic combination of constructs in the middleware layer of DSVMs to support the delivery of domain-specific services. This middleware should provide: (a) a model of execution (MoE) that dynamically integrates decoupled domain-specific knowledge (DSK) for service delivery, (b) runtime adaptability based on context and available resources, and (c) the same level of operational assurance as any DSVM middleware. Method Our approach will involve (1) defining a framework that supports the dynamic combination of MoE and DSK and (2) demonstrating the applicability of our framework in the DSVM middleware for user-centric communication. We will measure the overhead of our approach and provide a cost-benefit analysis factoring in its runtime adaptability using appropriate experimentation. Results Our experiments show that combining the DSK and MoE for a DSVM middleware allow us to realize efficient specialization while maintaining the required operability. We also show that the overhead introduced by adaptation is not necessarily deleterious to overall performance in a domain as it may result in more efficient operation selection. Conclusion The approach defined for the DSVM middleware allows for greater flexibility in service delivery while reducing the complexity of application development for the user. These benefits are achieved at the expense of increased execution times, however this increase may be negligible depending on the domain.

While many promising approaches for the construction of self-adaptive software systems have been developed, the majority of them ignore the uncertainty underlying the adaptation decisions.

POISED builds on possibility theory to assess both the positive and negative consequences of uncertainty. It makes adaptation decisions that result in the best range of potential behavior.

1029,1,"Dynamic deployment and quality adaptation for mobile augmented reality applications With the increasing popularity of smartphones and netbooks, more and more applications are developed for the mobile platform. Notwithstanding the recent advances in mobile hardware, most mobile devices still lack sufficient resources (e.g. CPU power and memory) to execute complex multimedia applications such as augmented reality. Application developers also have difficulties to cope with the changing device context (e.g. network connectivity and remaining battery life) and the many different hardware platforms and operating systems to run applications on. Therefore, we introduce the concept where the developer can provide different configurations of an application, each having different resource requirements and a different quality offered to the end user. The middleware framework presented in this paper will select and deploy the configuration offering the best quality possible for the current connectivity and available resources. As these change over time, the framework will dynamically adapt the configuration and deployment at runtime, enhancing the quality by offloading parts of the application when a remote server is discovered, or gracefully degrading the quality when the network connection is lost.

The event-based programming paradigm is a strong candidate for the development of mobile applications due to its inherent support for the loose coupling between components required by mobile applications. However, existing middleware that supports the event-based programming paradigm is not well suited to supporting location-aware mobile applications in which highly mobile components come together dynamically to collaborate at some location. This paper presents a number of techniques including location-independent announcement and subscription coupled with location-dependent filtering and event delivery that can be used by event-based middleware to support such collaboration.

1031,1,"Platys: an active learning framework for place-aware application development and its evaluation We introduce a high-level abstraction of location called place. A place derives its meaning from a user's physical space, activities, or social context. In this manner, place can facilitate improved user experience compared to the traditional representation of location, which is spatial coordinates. We propose the Platys framework as a way to address the special challenges of place-aware application development. The core of Platys is a middleware that (1) learns a model of places specific to each user via active learning, a machine learning paradigm that seeks to reduce the user-effort required for training the middleware, and (2) exposes the learned user-specific model of places to applications at run time, insulating application developers from dealing with both low-level sensors and user idiosyncrasies in perceiving places. We evaluated Platys via two studies. First, we collected place labels and Android phone sensor readings from 10 users. We applied Platys' active learning approach to learn each user's places and found that Platys (1) requires fewer place labels to learn a user's places with a desired accuracy than do two traditional supervised approaches, and (2) learns places with higher accuracy than two unsupervised approaches. Second, we conducted a developer study to evaluate Platys' efficiency in assisting developers and its effectiveness in enabling usable applications. In this study, 46 developers employed either Platys or the Android location API to develop a place-aware application. Our results indicate that application developers employing Platys, when compared to those employing the Android API, (1) develop a place-aware application faster and perceive reduced difficulty and (2) produce applications that are easier to understand (for developers) and potentially more usable and privacy preserving (for application users). semi-supervised learning,  place-aware,  usability,  middleware,  privacy,  place recognition,  context-aware,  location-aware,  active learning,  Mobile application development",platys an active learning framework for place aware application development and its evaluation we introduce a high level abstraction of location called place a place derives its meaning from a user s physical space activities or social context in this manner place can facilitate improved user experience compared to the traditional representation of location which is spatial coordinates we propose the platys framework as a way to address the special challenges of place aware application development the core of platys is a middleware that 1 learns a model of places specific to each user via active learning a machine learning paradigm that seeks to reduce the user effort required for training the middleware and 2 exposes the learned user specific model of places to applications at run time insulating application developers from dealing with both low level sensors and user idiosyncrasies in perceiving places we evaluated platys via two studies first we collected place labels and android phone sensor readings from 10 users we applied platys active learning approach to learn each user s places and found that platys 1 requires fewer place labels to learn a user s places with a desired accuracy than do two traditional supervised approaches and 2 learns places with higher accuracy than two unsupervised approaches second we conducted a developer study to evaluate platys efficiency in assisting developers and its effectiveness in enabling usable applications in this study 46 developers employed either platys or the android location api to develop a place aware application our results indicate that application developers employing platys when compared to those employing the android api 1 develop a place aware application faster and perceive reduced difficulty and 2 produce applications that are easier to understand for developers and potentially more usable and privacy preserving for application users semi supervised learning place aware usability middleware privacy place recognition context aware location aware active learning mobile application development,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0

Such illusion must consider the Internet as the system backbone, because users move. The challenge is providing a novel system while permitting the seamless integration of traditional legacy systems, which may be required to run on many computers and devices, if only to run their applications.

Modern programming frameworks already provide support for dynamic adaptations. However the high-variability of features in Dynamic Adaptive Systems (DAS) introduces an explosion of possible runtime system configurations (often called modes) and mode transitions. Designing these configurations and their transitions is tedious and error-prone, making the system feature evolution difficult. While Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM) was introduced to improve the modularity of software, this paper presents how an AOM approach can be used to tame the combinatorial explosion of DAS modes. Using AOM techniques, we derive a wide range of modes by weaving aspects into an explicit model reflecting the runtime system. We use these generated modes to automatically adapt the system. We validate our approach on an adaptive middleware for home-automation currently deployed in Rennes metropolis.

1034,1,"A context-aware reflective middleware framework for distributed real-time and embedded systems Context-aware reflective middleware (CARM), which supports application reconfiguration, has been an appealing technique for building distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems as it can adapt their behaviors to changing environments at run time. However, existing CARM frameworks impose dependence restrictions and reconfiguration overhead, which makes the reconfiguration time of these frameworks too long (normally in the range of seconds or more) to satisfy the stringent real-time requirements of DRE systems. To improve the reconfiguration efficiency for supporting DRE systems, we have designed a new CARM framework -- MARCHES (Middleware for Adaptive Robust Collaborations across Heterogeneous Environments and Systems), which offers an original structure of multiple component chains to reduce local behavior change time and a novel synchronization protocol using active messages to reduce distributed behavior synchronization time. MARCHES uses a layered architecture and provides both component-level and system-level reflection to incorporate standard components, a hierarchical event notification model to evaluate contexts, and a lightweight XML-based script language to describe and manage adaptation policies. The MARCHES framework and supported applications have been implemented on PC and PDA platforms. Based on a novel theoretical model, we have analyzed the reconfiguration efficiency of MARCHES and compared it with those of peer CARM frameworks: MobiPADS and CARISMA. Quantitative empirical results show that the reconfiguration time of MARCHES is reduced from seconds to hundreds of microseconds. Evaluations demonstrate that MARCHES is robust, scalable and generates a small memory footprint, which makes it suitable for supporting DRE systems.

A large body of such applications relies on user-configured adaptation rules to customize their behavior. We call them rule-based context-aware applications (or RBAs for short). Due to the complexity required for adequately modeling environmental dynamics, adaptation faults are common in these RBAs. One promising approach to detecting such faults is to build a state transition model for an RBA, and exhaustively explore the model's state space. However, it can suffer from numerous false positives. For example, 78.6% of 784 reported faults for one popular RBA -- PhoneAdapter, turn out to be false in a real deployment. In this paper, we address this false positive problem by inferring a domain model and an environment model for an RBA. The two models capture the hidden features inside user-configured adaptation rules as well as the RBA's running environment. We formulate these features as deterministic constraints and probabilistic constraints to prune false positives and effectively prioritize remaining faults.

1039,1,"An architecture-driven software mobility framework Software architecture has been shown to provide an appropriate level of granularity for assessing a software system's quality attributes (e.g., performance and dependability). Similarly, previous research has adopted an architecture-centric approach to reasoning about and managing the run-time adaptation of software systems. For mobile and pervasive software systems, which are known to be innately dynamic and unpredictable, the ability to assess a system's quality attributes and manage its dynamic run-time behavior is especially important. In the past, researchers have argued that a software architecture-based approach can be instrumental in facilitating mobile computing. In this paper, we present an integrated architecture-driven framework for modeling, analysis, implementation, deployment, and run-time migration of software systems executing on distributed, mobile, heterogeneous computing platforms.

A faulty context-aware application may, however, mistakenly mix up inconsistent contexts and resolved ones, causing incorrect results.

1041,1,"Partial constraint checking for context consistency in pervasive computing Pervasive computing environments typically change frequently in terms of available resources and their properties. Applications in pervasive computing use contexts to capture these changes and adapt their behaviors accordingly. However, contexts available to these applications may be abnormal or imprecise due to environmental noises. This may result in context inconsistencies, which imply that contexts conflict with each other. The inconsistencies may set such an application into a wrong state or lead the application to misadjust its behavior. It is thus desirable to detect and resolve the context inconsistencies in a timely way. One popular approach is to detect context inconsistencies when contexts breach certain consistency constraints. Existing constraint checking techniques recheck the entire expression of each affected consistency constraint upon context changes. When a changed context affects only a constraint's subexpression, rechecking the entire expression can adversely delay the detection of other context inconsistencies. This article proposes a rigorous approach to identifying the parts of previous checking results that are reusable without entire rechecking.

These applications continually adapt to environmental changes in an autonomic way. However, their adaptation may contain defects when the complexity of modeling all environmental changes is beyond a developer's ability. Such defects can cause failure to the adaptation and result in application crash or freezing. Relating these failures back to responsible defects is challenging. In this paper we propose a novel approach, called Adam, to assist identifying defects in the context-aware adaptation. Adam monitors runtime errors for an application, logs relevant error information, and relates them to responsible defects in this application. To make our Adam approach feasible, we investigate the error types that are commonly exhibited by various failures reported in context-aware applications. Adam detects these errors in order to identify responsible defects in context-aware applications. To detect these errors, Adam formally models the adaptation semantics for context-aware applications, and integrates into them a set of assertion checkers with respect to these error types.

1052,1,"Context-Aware Adaptive Applications: Fault Patterns and Their Automated Identification Applications running on mobile devices are intensely context-aware and adaptive. Streams of context values continuously drive these applications, making them very powerful but, at the same time, susceptible to undesired configurations. Such configurations are not easily exposed by existing validation techniques, thereby leading to new analysis and testing challenges. In this paper, we address some of these challenges by defining and applying a new model of adaptive behavior called an Adaptation Finite-State Machine (A-FSM) to enable the detection of faults caused by both erroneous adaptation logic and asynchronous updating of context information, with the latter leading to inconsistencies between the external physical context and its internal representation within an application. We identify a number of adaptation fault patterns, each describing a class of faulty behaviors. Finally, we describe three classes of algorithms to detect such faults automatically via analysis of the A-FSM. We evaluate our approach and the trade-offs between the classes of algorithms on a set of synthetically generated Context-Aware Adaptive Applications (CAAAs) and on a simple but realistic application in which a cell phone's configuration profile changes automatically as a result of changes to the user's location, speed, and surrounding environment.

Such reconfiguration is considerably simplified if mobile applications are component-oriented rather than monolithic blocks of code.

1058,1,"Cina: Suppressing the Detection of Unstable Context Inconsistency Context-aware applications adapt their behavior based on contexts. Contexts can, however, be incorrect. A popular means to build dependable applications is to augment them with a set of constraints to govern the consistency of context values. These constraints are evaluated upon context changes to detect inconsistencies so that they can be timely handled. However, we observe that many context inconsistencies are unstable. They vanish by themselves and do not require handling. Such inconsistencies are detected due to misaligned sensor sampling or improper inconsistency detection scheduling. We call them unstable context inconsistencies (or STINs). STINs should be avoided to prevent unnecessary inconsistency handling and unstable behavioral adaptation to applications. In this article, we study STINs systematically, from examples to theoretical analysis, and present algorithms to suppress their detection. Our key insight is that only certain patterns of context changes can make a consistency constraint subject to the detection of STINs. We derive such patterns and proactively use them to suppress the detection of STINs. We implemented our idea and applied it to real-world applications.
