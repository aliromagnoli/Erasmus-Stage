0,0,"Model Driven Development: The Case for Domain Oriented Programming In this paper, we offer an alternative vision for domain driven development (3D). Our approach is model driven and emphasizes the use of generic and specific domain oriented programming (DOP) languages. DOP uses strong specific languages, which directly incorporate domain abstractions, to allow knowledgeable end users to succinctly express their needs in the form of an application computation. Most domain driven development (3D) approaches and techniques are targeted at professional software engineers and computer scientists. We argue that DOP offers a promising alternative. Specifically we are focused on empowering application developers who have extensive domain knowledge as well as sound foundations in their professions, but may not be formally trained in computer science.We provide a brief survey of DOP experiences, which show that many of the best practices such as patterns, refactoring, and pair programming are naturally and ideally practiced in a Model Driven Development (MDD) setting. We compare and contrast our DOP with other popular approaches, most of which are deeply rooted in the OO community.Finally we highlight challenges and opportunities in the design and implementation of such languages. domain driven development, domain specific languages, end user programming, model driven development, programming by professional end users",model driven development the case for domain oriented programming in this paper we offer an alternative vision for domain driven development 3d our approach is model driven and emphasizes the use of generic and specific domain oriented programming dop languages dop uses strong specific languages which directly incorporate domain abstractions to allow knowledgeable end users to succinctly express their needs in the form of an application computation most domain driven development 3d approaches and techniques are targeted at professional software engineers and computer scientists we argue that dop offers a promising alternative specifically we are focused on empowering application developers who have extensive domain knowledge as well as sound foundations in their professions but may not be formally trained in computer science we provide a brief survey of dop experiences which show that many of the best practices such as patterns refactoring and pair programming are naturally and ideally practiced in a model driven development mdd setting we compare and contrast our dop with other popular approaches most of which are deeply rooted in the oo community finally we highlight challenges and opportunities in the design and implementation of such languages domain driven development domain specific languages end user programming model driven development programming by professional end users,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

Due to this trend, there is a practical need for techniques that evaluate critical properties (such as safety, reliability, availability or performance) of these systems. In this paper, we review several high-level techniques for the evaluation of safety properties for component-based systems and we propose a new evaluation model (State Event Fault Trees) that extends safety analysis towards a lower abstraction level. This model possesses a state-event semantics and strong encapsulation, which is especially useful for the evaluation of component-based software systems.

Web service standards, based on WSDL (Web Service Definition Language), have been adopted as process-to-process communication paradigms. However, the conceptual modeling of applications using Web services has not yet been addressed. Interaction with Web services is often specified at the level of the source code; thus, Web service interfaces are buried within a programmatic specification.In this article, we argue that Web services should be considered first-class citizens in the specification of Web applications. Thus, service-enabled Web applications should benefit from the high-level modeling and automatic code generation techniques that have long been advocated for Web application design and implementation. To this end, we extend a declarative model for specifying data-intensive Web applications in two directions: (i) high-level modeling of Web services and their interactions with the Web applications which use them, and (ii) modeling and specification of Web applications implementing new, complex Web services.Our approach is fully implemented within a CASE tool allowing the high-level modeling and automatic deployment of service-enabled Web applications.

DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage.Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, we identify patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. Our patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns.

In UML version 1.x, this was accomplished by means of permitting virtual subtyping in the metamodel. However, this facility led many to misuse stereotypes, particularly in places where regular domain-level modelling would be more appropriate. In version 2.0 of the UML, the portion of the metamodel pertaining to stereotypes was drastically revised. The resulting mechanism is reviewed here and compared with that of version 1.x.

The introduction of computers and computer software more than a half century ago create unprecedented opportunities in this regard: they can not only help us automate the physical processes involved in production but also many of the highly mechanistic and error-prone mental processes involved in design. The opportunity provided by software and computers in this regard is without precedent. Yet, when one reviews the history of computer-based automation in the process of software design, we find that, following the invention of compilers almost fifty years ago, the use of computer-based automation has made little difference in the lives and methods of the vast majority of software developers.

The translation of feature models to propositional logics enabled the use of reasoning systems, such as BDD engines, for the analysis and transformation of such models and interactive configurations. Unfortunately, the size of a BDD structure is highly sensitive to the variable ordering used in its construction and an inappropriately chosen ordering may prevent the translation of a feature model into a BDD representation of a tractable size. Finding an optimal order is NP-hard and has for long been addressed by using heuristics. We review existing general heuristics and heuristics from the hardware circuits domain and experimentally show that they are not effective in reducing the size of BDDs produced from feature models. Based on that analysis we introduce two new heuristics for compiling feature models to BDDs.

13,0,"HLA Supported, Federation Oriented Enterprise Interoperability, Application to Aerospace Enterprises The field of research, which address distributed enterprises interoperability implementation with HLA (High Level Architecture), was initiated in the final report on future trends of INTEROP Network of Excellence [1]. This report presents fields of investigation to support large federation oriented enterprise interoperability and state the requirement of interoperability transition from concepts to implementation. In this paper, we present, in a first point, the enterprise modeling and the enterprise interoperability concepts. A unifying three dimensional framework has been proposed in [2] for enterprise interoperability to represent the ability of interactions between enterprise systems. In this approach, the interoperability is considered as significant if the interactions can take place at least at the three different levels of conceptual abstraction and if interoperability barriers can be bridged. Then, an interoperability approach can be proposed considering the degree of integration between the different enterprises. After that, we give a review of ongoing researches using HLA to support enterprise interoperability execution. Indeed, the HLA standard, initially designed for military M&S purpose, can be transposed for enterprise interoperability at the implementation level, reusing the years of experiences in distributed systems. Then, we conclude the state of the art part by presenting MDA (Model Driven Architecture) methodology that assists the transformation of enterprise models from conceptual level to models for execution or simulation and the emerging MDI (Model Driven Interoperability) methodology for considering the interoperability transformation. We have recalled complementary levels of abstraction to describe enterprise models and a methodology to transform them, but there is no completed methodology for distributed Enterprise modeling, addressing interoperability consideration at each level.

14,0,"Context-aware and Mobile Interactive Systems: The Future of User Interfaces Plasticity Mobility and integration of systems into the physical environment are key challenges for computer science. In particular, User Interfaces (UI) must accommodate variations in the context of use while preserving human-centered properties. We call this capacity UI plasticity. This tutorial begins by reviewing ideas from the last decade concerning the plasticity of user interfaces. From this starting point, it develops key ideas and perspectives for the near future. These are illustrated with a demo of a tool for prototyping plastic widgets and UIs. In the near future, there will be a need for elaborating a theory of adaptation to predict and explain the difficulties that users encounter when adaptation occurs. Secondly, in order to go beyond simplistic UI adaptation, there will be a need to bring together advances in several research areas including HCI (to support multimodality), Software Engineering (in particular, Model-Driven Engineering, Aspect Oriented Programming, as well as components and services, to cover both design time and run time adaptation), as well as Artificial Intelligence (to support situated information and planning). Indeed, in most current research, the user's task model is assumed as given and is used as the starting point for generating UIs on the fly. In addition, the functional core is considered to be stable rather than compliant with opportunistic discovery of services. In the coming years, we will need to confront challenges that go beyond HCI: (1) incompleteness and uncertainty of the system perception of both the context of use and of the appropriateness of the adapted UI; (2) combinatory explosion when composing a UI for sustaining emergent users goals.

This article addresses the conceptual model quality as it has been widely accepted that better conceptual models produce better information systems and thus implicitly improve the data quality. Conceptual Models are designed as part of the analysis phase and serve as a communicating mediator between the users and the development team. Consequently, their understandability is a real challenge to avoid the propagation of inaccurate interpretation of the user requirements to the underlying system design and implementation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quality model. We illustrate its usefulness by describing how it can be used to model and evaluate the understandability of conceptual models.

Systems such as XVCL, DMS, ASF+SDF, Stratego and TXL have proven mature, efficient and effective in a wide range of applications. Even so, adoption remains a serious issue - almost all successful production applications of these systems in practice either involve help from the original authors or years of experience to get rolling. While work on accessibility is active, with efforts such as ETXL, Stratego XT, Rascal and Colm, the fundamental big step remains - it's not obvious how to apply a general purpose transformational system to any given generation or transformation problem, and the real power is in the paradigms of use, not the languages themselves. In this talk I will propose an agenda for addressing this problem by taking our own advice - designing and implementing domain specific languages (DSLs) for specific generative, transformational and analysis problem domains.

CWS tackles the scheduling problem by inferring the expected sizes of upcoming jobs based on the structure of correlations and on the outcome of past scheduling decisions. Size prediction is achieved using a class of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with continuous observation densities that describe job sizes. We show how the forward-backward algorithm of HMMs applies effectively in scheduling applications and how it can be used to derive closed-form expressions for size prediction. This is particularly simple to implement in the case of observation densities that are phase-type (PH-type) distributed, where existing fitting methods for Markovian point processes may also simplify the parameterization of the HMM workload model. Based on the job size predictions, CWS emulates size-based policies which favor short jobs, with accuracy depending mainly on the HMM used to parametrize the scheduling algorithm. Extensive simulation and analysis illustrate that CWS is competitive with policies that assume exact information about the workload. correlated workload, model-driven scheduling, response time, stochastic sheduling",cws a model driven scheduling policy for correlated workloads we define cws a non preemptive scheduling policy for workloads with correlated job sizes cws tackles the scheduling problem by inferring the expected sizes of upcoming jobs based on the structure of correlations and on the outcome of past scheduling decisions size prediction is achieved using a class of hidden markov models hmm with continuous observation densities that describe job sizes we show how the forward backward algorithm of hmms applies effectively in scheduling applications and how it can be used to derive closed form expressions for size prediction this is particularly simple to implement in the case of observation densities that are phase type ph type distributed where existing fitting methods for markovian point processes may also simplify the parameterization of the hmm workload model based on the job size predictions cws emulates size based policies which favor short jobs with accuracy depending mainly on the hmm used to parametrize the scheduling algorithm extensive simulation and analysis illustrate that cws is competitive with policies that assume exact information about the workload correlated workload model driven scheduling response time stochastic sheduling,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

21,0,"Disciplined Heterogeneous Modeling Complex systems demand diversity in the modeling mechanisms. One way to deal with a diversity of requirements is to create flexible modeling frameworks that can be adapted to cover the field of interest. The downside of this approach is a weakening of the semantics of the modeling frameworks that compromises interoperability, understandability, and analyzability of the models. An alternative approach is to embrace heterogeneity and to provide mechanisms for a diversity of models to interact. This paper reviews an approach that achieves such interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework. It instead focuses on the interactions between diverse models, reducing the nature of those interactions to a minimum that achieves a well-defined composition. An example of such an abstract semantics is the actor semantics, which can handle many heterogeneous models that are built today, and some that are not common today.

Domain-Specific Modelling has become accepted as a powerful means of providing domain experts and end users with the ability to create and manipulate models within the systems that they use. In this paper we argue that there are domains for which it is appropriate to also provide domain experts with the ability to modify and develop model transformations.

RESTful web services are an alternative to Remote Procedure Call technologies like SOAP and WS-* services. There are many frameworks for implementing RESTful applications, but there is still a lack of support for the early phases of the development process, particularly analysis and design. For building formal models of RESTful applications an appropriate metamodel is needed. After analyzing existing approaches and techniques a first version of such a REST metamodel is presented and used to model an example application.

30,0,"Model-driven Optimization of Opportunistic Routing Opportunistic routing aims to improve wireless performance by exploiting communication opportunities arising by chance. A key challenge in opportunistic routing is how to achieve good, predictable performance despite the incidental nature of such communication opportunities and the complicated effects of wireless interference in IEEE 802.11 networks. To address the challenge, we develop a model-driven optimization framework to jointly optimize opportunistic routes and rate limits for both unicast and multicast traffic. A distinctive feature of our framework is that the performance derived from optimization can be achieved in a real IEEE 802.11 network. Our framework consists of three key components: (i) a model for capturing the interference among IEEE 802.11 broadcast transmissions, (ii) a novel algorithm for accurately optimizing different performance objectives, and (iii) effective techniques for mapping the resulting solutions to practical routing configurations. Extensive simulations and testbed experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art shortest path routing and opportunistic routing protocols. Moreover, the difference between the achieved performance and our model estimation is typically within 20%. Evaluation in dynamic and uncontrolled environments further shows that our approach is robust against inaccuracy introduced by a dynamic network and it also consistently out-performs the existing schemes. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach. model-driven optimization, opportunistic routing, wireless interference, wireless mesh networks, wireless network model",model driven optimization of opportunistic routing opportunistic routing aims to improve wireless performance by exploiting communication opportunities arising by chance a key challenge in opportunistic routing is how to achieve good predictable performance despite the incidental nature of such communication opportunities and the complicated effects of wireless interference in ieee 802 11 networks to address the challenge we develop a model driven optimization framework to jointly optimize opportunistic routes and rate limits for both unicast and multicast traffic a distinctive feature of our framework is that the performance derived from optimization can be achieved in a real ieee 802 11 network our framework consists of three key components i a model for capturing the interference among ieee 802 11 broadcast transmissions ii a novel algorithm for accurately optimizing different performance objectives and iii effective techniques for mapping the resulting solutions to practical routing configurations extensive simulations and testbed experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art shortest path routing and opportunistic routing protocols moreover the difference between the achieved performance and our model estimation is typically within 20 evaluation in dynamic and uncontrolled environments further shows that our approach is robust against inaccuracy introduced by a dynamic network and it also consistently out performs the existing schemes these results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach model driven optimization opportunistic routing wireless interference wireless mesh networks wireless network model,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

While very useful, hardware prefetching tends to aggravate the bandwidth wall, a problem where system performance is increasingly limited by the availability of the off-chip pin bandwidth in Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs). In this paper, we propose an analytical model-based study to investigate how hardware prefetching and memory bandwidth partitioning impact CMP system performance and how they interact. The model includes a composite prefetching metric that can help determine under which conditions prefetching can improve system performance, a bandwidth partitioning model that takes into account prefetching effects, and a derivation of the weighted speedup optimum bandwidth partition sizes for different cores. Through model-driven case studies, we find several interesting observations that can be valuable for future CMP system design and optimization. We also explore simulation-based empirical evaluation to validate the observations and show that maximum system performance can be achieved by selective prefetching, guided by the composite prefetching metric, coupled with dynamic bandwidth partitioning. analytical model, chip multiprocessors, hardware prefetching, memory bandwidth partitioning",studying the impact of hardware prefetching and bandwidth partitioning in chip multiprocessors modern high performance microprocessors widely employ hardware prefetching technique to hide long memory access latency while very useful hardware prefetching tends to aggravate the bandwidth wall a problem where system performance is increasingly limited by the availability of the off chip pin bandwidth in chip multi processors cmps in this paper we propose an analytical model based study to investigate how hardware prefetching and memory bandwidth partitioning impact cmp system performance and how they interact the model includes a composite prefetching metric that can help determine under which conditions prefetching can improve system performance a bandwidth partitioning model that takes into account prefetching effects and a derivation of the weighted speedup optimum bandwidth partition sizes for different cores through model driven case studies we find several interesting observations that can be valuable for future cmp system design and optimization we also explore simulation based empirical evaluation to validate the observations and show that maximum system performance can be achieved by selective prefetching guided by the composite prefetching metric coupled with dynamic bandwidth partitioning analytical model chip multiprocessors hardware prefetching memory bandwidth partitioning,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0
32,0,"A Survey on UML-based Aspect-oriented Design Modeling Aspect-orientation provides a new way of modularization by clearly separating crosscutting concerns from noncrosscutting ones. While aspect-orientation originally has emerged at the programming level, it now stretches also over other development phases. There are, for example, already several proposals for Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM), most of them pursuing distinguished goals, providing different concepts as well as notations, and showing various levels of maturity. Consequently, there is an urgent need to provide an in-depth survey, clearly identifying commonalities and differences between current AOM approaches. Existing surveys in this area focus more on comprehensibility with respect to development phases or evaluated approaches rather than on comparability on bases of a detailed evaluation framework. This article tries to fill this gap focusing on aspect-oriented design modeling. As a prerequisite for an in-depth evaluation, a conceptual reference model is presented as the article's first contribution, centrally capturing the basic design concepts of AOM and their interrelationships in terms of a UML class diagram. Based on this conceptual reference model, an evaluation framework has been designed, resembling the second contribution, by deriving a detailed and well-defined catalogue of evaluation criteria, thereby operationalizing the conceptual reference model. This criteria catalogue is employed together with a running example in order to evaluate a carefully selected set of eight design-level AOM approaches representing the third contribution of the article. This per approach evaluation is complemented with an extensive report on lessons learned, summarizing the approaches' strengths and shortcomings.

33,0,"Real-world Performance Modelling of Enterprise Service Oriented Architectures: Delivering Business Value with Complexity and Constraints (Abstracts Only) Performance and Scalability Modelling of real-world enterprise systems is challenging due to both the complexity and size of the system being modelled, and constraints imposed by real projects such as the need to provide business value, deadlines, and the accessibility, relevance, quality and quantity of available documentation and performance data. Our hypothesis is that enterprise Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) are more amenable to performance modelling as services are more granular, visible, and measurable. Since 2007 we have developed, trialled and refined a method with model-driven tool support for directly modelling the performance and scalability of increasingly complex Service Oriented Architectures. This paper reports an illustrative experience modelling a large-scale production SOA Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) upgrade, focussing on lessons learnt related to the complexity and constraints of modelling in the real-world. The key observations are that model construction is a type of theory formation and therefore: (1) Models (functioning as theories) can be simple but powerful enough to model large complex SOAs within the boundaries of real project constraints; (2) Model formation can be incremental, starting with a simple model (as simple theories are easier to refute) and refining as required; (3) Building multiple competing models can be a useful approach if information is inadequate or ambiguous, as the rival models can be tested with the aim of discarding incorrect ones; (4) If insufficient information is available to build a single ""über"" model to answer all the performance questions, it is often possible to build multiple specialised models for different purposes.

This survey involved 32 software developers with 75% of the participants having more than 5 years of experience with class diagrams. As the result, we found that the important elements in a class diagram are class relationship, meaningful class names and class properties. We also found that information that should be excluded in a simplified class diagram is GUI related information, private and protected operations, helper classes and library classes. In this survey we also tried to discover what types of features are needed for class diagram simplification tools.

As an application domain CPS is not new. As an intellectual discipline, however, it is. This paper focuses on CPS modeling, which is an essential activity in CPS design, with multiple challenges. In particular, stakeholders lack a systematic framework and guidelines to help them choose among the many available modeling languages and tools. We propose such a framework in this paper. Our framework consists of three elements: viewpoints, which capture the stakeholders' interests and concerns; concrete languages and tools, among which the stakeholders must make a selection when defining their CPS design environments; and abstract, mathematical formalisms, which are the ""semantic glue"" linking the two worlds. As part of the framework, we survey various formalisms, languages, and tools and explain how they are related. We also provide examples of viewpoints and discuss how they are related to formalisms.

Architectural decisions impact all subsequent phases in software development life cycle. Structure of large software systems has been in discussion since early 70s but software architecture started emerging as separate discipline since mid-90s. Objective: Researchers have been publishing empirical studies (i.e. case studies, experiments, experience reports) in SA discipline. Empirical literature has been aggregated in other disciplines of software engineering but no such effort has been made in SA. Objective of this study is to aggregate and synthesize the empirical evidence from literature of software architecture to report the trends, patterns and knowledge gaps. Method: To synthesize the empirical work in SA, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR). This study reports the results of SLR based on 247 included primary studies. Results: Based on the percentage of 247 primary studies we identified that SA Evaluation (28%), non- functional requirements related work (22%) and SA Design (12%) are relatively mature sub areas of SA. Most of the empirical work (59%) in SA uses case study research method. Experiments (20%) and experience reports (14%) are also employed in empirical SA work. Conclusion: SA discipline is maturing as few sub areas of SA are mature and some areas are new and being developed.

47,0,"Illustrating the AADL Error Modeling Annex (V.2) Using a Simple Safety-critical Medical Device Developing and certifying safety-critical and highly reliable systems almost always includes significant emphasis on hazard analysis and risk assessment. There have been substantial improvements in automation and formalization of other aspects of critical system engineering including model-driven development, analysis of source code and models, and verification techniques. However, hazard analysis and risk assessment are still largely manual and informal activities, tool support is limited (which for both development and auditing, increases time and effort and reduces accuracy and correctness), and artifacts are not integrated with architectural descriptions, system interfaces, high-level behavioral descriptions or code. The Error Model annex of the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) provides formal and automated support for a variety of forms of hazard analysis and risk assessment activities. Specifically, it enables engineers to formally specify errors, error propagation, error mitigation -- using annotations that are integrated with formal architecture and behavioral descriptions written in AADL. Plug-ins to the Open-Source AADL Tool Environment (OSATE) process these annotations to provide various forms of (semi)-automated support for reliability predication and tasks necessary to support common hazard analysis and risk assessment techniques such as Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and Functional Hazard Analysis (FHA). In this paper, we illustrate basic aspects of Error Modeling in AADL using a simple safety-critical medical system -- an infant incubator called ""Isolette"".

55,0,"Mitigating DoS Attacks Using Performance Model-Driven Adaptive Algorithms Denial of Service (DoS) attacks overwhelm online services, preventing legitimate users from accessing a service, often with impact on revenue or consumer trust. Approaches exist to filter network-level attacks, but application-level attacks are harder to detect at the firewall. Filtering at this level can be computationally expensive and difficult to scale, while still producing false positives that block legitimate users. This article presents a model-based adaptive architecture and algorithm for detecting DoS attacks at the web application level and mitigating them. Using a performance model to predict the impact of arriving requests, a decision engine adaptively generates rules for filtering traffic and sending suspicious traffic for further review, where the end user is given the opportunity to demonstrate they are a legitimate user. If no legitimate user responds to the challenge, the request is dropped.

56,0,"Hardware Acceleration for an Accurate Stereo Vision System Using Mini-Census Adaptive Support Region Domain of stereo vision is highly important in the fields of autonomous cars, video tolling, robotics, and aerial surveys. The specific feature of this domain is that we should handle not only the pixel-by-pixel 2D processing in one image but also the 3D processing for depth estimation by comparing information about a scene from several images with different perspectives. This feature brings challenges to memory resource utilization, because an extra dimension of data has to be buffered. Due to the memory limitation, few of previous stereo vision implementations provide both accurate and high-speed processing for high-resolution images at the same time. To achieve domain-specific acceleration for stereo vision, the memory limitation has to be addressed. This article uses a Mini-Census ADaptive Support Region (MCADSR) stereo matching algorithm as a case study due to its high accuracy and representative operations in this domain. To relieve the memory limitation and achieve high-speed processing, the article proposes several efficient optimization methods including vertical-first cost aggregation, hybrid parallel processing, and hardware-friendly integral image. The article also presents a customizable system which provides both accurate and high-speed stereo matching for high-resolution images. The benefits of applying the optimization methods to the system are highlighted. With the aforesaid optimization and specific customization implemented on FPGA, the demonstrated system can process 47.6 fps (frames per second) and 129 fps for video size of 1920 × 1080 with a large disparity range of 256 and 1024 × 768 with a disparity range of 128, respectively.

60,0,"Enhancing the Communication Value of UML Models with Graphical Layers UML is defined as a visual modeling language for specifying, constructing, and documenting software intensive systems. In that context, UML diagrams play a central role in the whole software engineering process, starting from early analysis, through implementation, to maintenance. Recent surveys of UML use in industry showed that software practitioners use it on a regular basis, and particularly for communication and as a mental-assist tool. However, they also pointed out the following weaknesses: the lack of context, graphical layout problems, and the language's inadequacy as a facility for communication between technical teams and their clients. In this paper, we present a general approach that addresses these problems by enhancing the effectiveness of UML models as a communication vehicle. Our approach is based on expressing stakeholder-specific viewpoints through the use of secondary notations. This involves the use of auxiliary visual variables (e.g., color, position, size) that are not formally specified in UML. To that end, we extend the traditional concept of layer found in many graphical editors to UML diagram editors. FlipLayers is an implementation of our approach. It is in the form of a plugin for the Papyrus modeling environment. One scenario with several case studies is presented in the paper to demonstrate the benefits of our approach and also to illustrate how to express viewpoints with FlipLayers.

However, their direct application to a large code base is costly and severely impacts program maintainability. While recently introduced domain-specific languages facilitate the application of such transformations, they typically still require manual tuning or auto-tuning techniques to select the transformations that yield optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce MODESTO, a model-driven stencil optimization framework, that for a stencil program suggests program transformations optimized for a given target architecture. Initially, we review and categorize data locality transformations for stencil programs and introduce a stencil algebra that allows the expression and enumeration of different stencil program implementation variants. Combining this algebra with a compile-time performance model, we show how to automatically tune stencil programs. We use our framework to model the STELLA library and optimize kernels used by the COSMO atmospheric model on multi-core and hybrid CPU-GPU architectures.

68,0,"Comparisons of predictions of net primary production and seasonal patterns in water use derived with two forest growth models in Southwestern Oregon In this paper, we compare predictions made with two forest growth models of maximum annual net primary production and seasonal trends in the constraints imposed by different climatic variables at 18 sites in the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon. One model, 3-PGS, is a production model driven by remote sensing data, running at monthly time steps, while the other, BIOME-BGC, is a complex eco-physiological model run at daily time steps. Both models include subroutines for predicting the interception of radiation and its dissipation as energy for evaporating water and the absorbed fraction that is photosynthetically active (400--700 nm). The models differ in a number of ways, including the estimation of canopy dynamics, calculation of respiration, use of growth modifiers and below ground mechanisms. In 3-PGS, canopy dynamics are derived from remote sensing inputs, and autotrophic respiration is assumed a constant fraction of gross photosynthesis=0.53; in BIOME-BGC, the canopy biomass is accumulated through allocation, with respiration a function of live biomass, temperature, and nitrogen content. BIOME-BGC includes decomposition and nitrogen mineralization subroutines, while 3-PGS incorporates these processes through an index of soil fertility. Plot-based information was available at each site on species composition, site productivity, phenology, and seasonal trends in plant water relations. Long-term averages of minimum/maximum temperature and precipitation were extrapolated from local meteorological stations and converted into estimates of solar radiation, daytime vapor pressure deficits, and frequency of subfreezing temperatures for the sites, which ranged in elevation from 550 to 2135 m and had varying slopes and aspects. State-wide soil survey data were interpreted to estimate soil water holding capacity and fertility. Satellite-derived data were used to drive 3-PGS and to validate predictions of leaf area by BIOME-BCG. The two models gave similar annual estimates of total net primary production (r2=0.85, slope=0.64, intercept: 2.26 Mg ha−1 year−1) but differed in their presentation of photosynthetic activity seasonally. 3-PGS has a suboptimal temperature function that provides more realistically limits on photosynthesis during the dormant season than assumed by BIOME-BGC. BIOME-BGC predicted seasonal variation in the ratio of autotrophic respiration to gross photosynthesis from 0.4 to 0.7, but over the year, the average was similar to that assumed by 3-PGS (0.58$\pm$0.05). We discovered that Landsat imagery with 30 m spatial resolution was reasonably correlated with leaf area indices as predicted by the BIOME-BGC model, but a variation still occurred associated with small areas where outcrops of serpentine restricted canopy development.

69,0,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Women Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was introduced into the psychiatric nomenclature in 1980 as an attempt to differentiate chronic excessive worry from paroxysmal attacks of anxiety consistent with panic disorder.3 Since that time, the diagnostic category has undergone substantial refinement. Initially, a diagnosis of GAD was eclipsed in the setting of selected other psychiatric diagnoses, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and psychotic disorders.3, 4 With the publication of the DSM-III-R, the minimum duration of illness was extended from 1 month to 6 months. In the DSM-IV, the duration of illness was retained, but the exclusionary rule in relation to MDD or psychotic disorders was eliminated. Thus, the variations in clinical criteria since GAD was introduced may have influenced what can be said definitively about its epidemiology, course, and clinical correlates. GAD, according to the DSM-IV, is excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for a period of at least 6 months.5 Also, accompanying the primary anxiety and worry are restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, disturbed sleep or a combination of these. The worry is pervasive and intrusive to daily functioning. These symptoms are experienced in far greater proportion than the current life situation would warrant. Three centers from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study queried participants about generalized anxiety using DSM-III criteria. The rates are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the 12-month prevalence rate in women is approximately double the rate in men whether the comorbidity exclusions are suspended (2.4% in men and 5.0% in women) or left in place (1.9% in men and 3.4% in women).8 There are substantial variations in the likelihood of suffering from GAD for various age and ethnic groups (Table 2). The highest 12-month rates for GAD (with suspension of exclusionary criteria) are found in African-American women less than age 30 years and Hispanic women aged 45 to 64 years. In both instances, the rate was more than 10%.8 The preponderance of women with GAD is confirmed by data from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS).35 The 12-month prevalence rate for GAD using DSM-III-R criteria (which commanded a 6-month duration of illness) was 2.0% in men and 4.3% in women. The lifetime prevalence rates were 3.6% in men and 6.6% in women. The similarity in 12-month prevalence rates in ECA and NCS are notable, especially given the different definitions in illness duration. This reflects the fact that, although DSM-III stipulated only a 1-month duration of symptoms, 40% of patients were symptomatic for 5 years or longer.8 GAD commonly is found among patients seen in primary care settings. The Collaborative Study on Psychological Problems in General Health Care18 investigated the rate of several common psychiatric illnesses across 15 primary care centers on four continents. The investigators suggest that varying prevalence rates among countries support a psychosocial cause to the sex differences for the disorder, while similar prevalence rates worldwide may support biologically based sex differences in the cause of illness. The investigators calculated the prevalence and gender ratios for MDD, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and GAD. Although rates for MDD and panic disorder among men and women presenting to a primary care setting across countries were not significantly different, there were significant gender by center interactions, indicating a lack of consistency for GAD. The average point prevalence of GAD in men was 5.7%, whereas in women it was 9.2% (N = 705). The highest percentage (25.8%) of anxious women was found in Brazil (compared with 14.1% of Brazilian men) and the lowest rate of anxious women was found in Turkey (1.1%, compared with 0.5% of anxious Turkish men). Interestingly, the second lowest percentage rating of anxious women (1.4%) was found in Seattle, Washington, the only US site, and one of the three sites where men reported higher frequency of GAD than did women (3.7% vs 1.4%). Given the inconsistency in GAD among the various centers, the investigators suggest that this anxiety disorder is connected to gender-specific social roles or experiences.

71,0,"Neurobiology of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a relatively new diagnostic entity first defined as a distinct category in the DSM-III.7 Two major epidemiologic studies, the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being2 and the National Comorbidity Survey120 have shown an incidence of 3.6% and 3.1% per year, respectively. Based on the National Comorbidity Survey data in the United States alone, more than 9 million people are afflicted with GAD at some point during their lifetimes. Also, GAD is one of the most common psychiatric disorders seen by primary care physicians. GAD was once considered by many clinicians to be a relatively mild condition, but new scientific data have challenged the perception that GAD is mild and minimally disabling. GAD has been found to be associated with various adverse social consequences, such as being more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups, being poorly paid, being on disability, and experiencing more marital instability and divorce than the general population.12 GAD has a lifetime comorbidity rate of 62% with major depressive disorder (MDD), 39.5% with dysthymia, 37.6% with alcoholism, and 34.4% with social phobia. Comorbid GAD seems to be associated with an even greater level of functional impairment than GAD alone. Follow-up studies have shown a substantial impairment and even poorer outcome among people with GAD than among those with panic disorder.121, 125 Thus, it is evident that GAD is neither an infrequent nor mild condition but an important public health problem that merits additional research on treatment and mechanism of illness. The diagnostic concept of GAD, however, is somewhat controversial. Some investigators have suggested that GAD is a residual or prodromal phase of MDD,92, 98 or a ``forme fruste'' of MDD.61 Other investigators have observed that it is attributable to other anxiety disorders, such as social phobia81 or panic disorder.114 Still others have conceptualized GAD as a dimension of personality function, a generalized anxious temperament that, when pronounced, constitutes psychopathology,4 whereas other investigators have conceptualized GAD as a part of a general neurotic syndrome.113 A well-designed 5-year longitudinal follow-up study, however, showed significant diagnostic stability for GAD, supporting the reliability of the diagnosis.121 Thus additional research must be carried out to clarify the diagnostic boundaries of GAD so that meaningful conclusions may be drawn from research studies. This article provides a concise picture of preclinical and clinical research pertinent to the neurobiology of GAD. Research on functional neuroanatomy and fear circuitry; animal models relevant to GAD; research on the genetics of GAD; and neurochemistry, neurophysiology, and functional imaging studies relevant to GAD are discussed. Finally, a crucial discussion of several biological models of GAD is presented, and paths for future research are suggested.

72,0,"Bioinformatics for the genomic sciences and towards systems biology. Japanese activities in the post-genome era The knowledge gleaned from genome sequencing and post-genome analyses is having a very significant impact on a whole range of life sciences and their applications. `Genome-wide analysis' is a good keyword to represent this tendency. Thanks to innovations in high-throughput measurement technologies and information technologies, genome-wide analysis is becoming available in a broad range of research fields from DNA sequences, gene and protein expressions, protein structures and interactions, to pathways or networks analysis. In fact, the number of research targets has increased by more than two orders in recent years and we should change drastically the attitude to research activities. The scope and speed of research activities are expanding and the field of bioinformatics is playing an important role. In parallel with the data-driven research approach that focuses on speedy handling and analyzing of the huge amount of data, a new approach is gradually gaining power. This is a `model-driven research' approach, that incorporates biological modeling in its research framework. Computational simulations of biological processes play a pivotal role. By modeling and simulating, this approach aims at predicting and even designing the dynamic behaviors of complex biological systems, which is expected to make rapid progress in life science researches and lead to meaningful applications to various fields such as health care, food supply and improvement of environment.

73,0,"The relationship between parental diagnosis, offspring temperament and offspring psychopathology: a longitudinal analysis Background: The study examines the relationship between child temperament and a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression as an adult and what influence parent psychopathology may have on the temperament-diagnosis relationship. Methods: The sample consists of 151 offspring who were initially selected as being at high or low risk for major depression on the basis of the presence or absence of a lifetime history of MDD in their parents. The parents and offspring were independently interviewed with a modified version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime (Mannuzza et al., 1986) and completed a battery of instruments which included the Dimensions of Temperament Survey (Lerner et al., 1982). They were interviewed three times during the course of the study: Time 1, Time 2, and Time 10. Results: There is a similar distribution of offspring disorders in the same parental diagnostic groups. There is a significant temperamental difference between the offspring of parents with a single disorder in comparison to offspring of parents with comorbid disorder. The former is characterized by significantly greater levels of adaptability/approachability. Low attention span at Time 1 is significantly predictive of an offspring lifetime diagnosis of major depression controlling for ADHD in comparison to offspring with neither disorder. Greater irritability, higher activity level and lower adaptability at Time 1 were significantly predictive of offspring lifetime diagnosis of comorbid disorder in comparison to the MDD only group. Limitations: This is a retrospective cohort study using a temperament measure from Time 1 versus lifetime diagnoses and consisting of a relatively small sample size for several of the diagnostic categories. Conclusions: There appears to be a link between parental psychopathology and offspring temperament. The data also provide further support for the notion that comorbid anxiety and depression disorder is a distinct entity in comparison to MDD only and new evidence that it may be predicted by a specific underlying temperament profile.

75,0,"Comparison of statistical indices using third order statistics for nonlinearity detection In this paper we discuss the efficiency of nonlinearity indices based on higher order statistics in order to detect nonlinearities in an observed signal, the signal being the output of a transmission channel (possibly nonlinear) the input of which is not accessible. Nonlinearity detection is the first step of nonlinearity analysis, this step being followed by nonlinearity location of the nonlinear components (in the Fourier domain) and quantification of these components. The main results reported in this paper are, first, a systematic survey of the robustness of hypothesis testing for each index and, second, the derivation of indices which neither involve the ratio of estimated quantities (such as bicoherence) nor phase unwrapping (such as the bicepstrum). The robustness of hypothesis testing is verified by calculating type II error probability (i.e. the error of declaring that the time series has been produced by a linear system while produced by a nonlinear one). To calculate this error, the observed time series is assumed to be the output of a second-order Volterra model driven by a Gaussian distributed noise. Obviously, the assumption of such a model might seem restrictive, but the results obtained allow us to draw some definitive conclusions about the robustness of the indices presented. The calculation is performed first from a theoretical spectrum and bispectrum and, second, from estimated indices. These indices are estimated from linear and nonlinear time series having the same spectrum.

Participants were 72 patients with SAD enrolled in an on-going multicentre study in Canada, and 72 patients with nonseasonal major depressive disorder (MDD) matched for severity of depression attending an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia. All participants completed two measures of QoL (the 20-item Medical Outcomes Study [MOS] Short-Form General Health Survey [SF-20] and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire [Q-LES-Q]) at baseline prior to treatment. The results of the study indicated that both generic and health-related QoL were compromised in patients with SAD compared with general population norms. For example, mean Q-LES-Q scores (range 0--100, where higher scores indicate better QoL) were 44%, compared with scores of 83% reported for the general population. Patients with nonseasonal depression showed significantly poorer functioning in several domains on the SF-20, but no significant differences in Q-LES-Q scores emerged. Perceived QoL is impaired in patients with SAD. Degree of impairment between seasonal and nonseasonal depressives is equivalent when assessed using the Q-LES-Q, but significant inter-group differences are apparent in SF-20 domain scores. Future research is required to determine whether perceived QoL is improved by treatment interventions for seasonal depression such as light therapy or antidepressant medication.

77,0,"A cost-effectiveness model of escitalopram, citalopram,and venlafaxine as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder in Belgium Background: Economic evaluations aim to combinecosts and patient outcomes in one analysis. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of escitalopram (vs all available competitors) for first-line treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Belgium. Methods: A 2-path decision analytic model with a 6-month horizon was used. All patients (baseline scores on the Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], ≥18 to ≤40) started at the primary path, and were referred to specialist care in the secondary care path. Model inputs included the following: probabilities from a meta-analysis of comparative trials data, an ad-hoc survey to evaluate pharmacologic treatment of depression in Belgium, literature, and a panel of experts. Main outcome measures were success (ie, remission [defined as MADRS ≤12]) and costs of treatment (ie, drug costs and medical care). Analyses were performed from the perspectives of the Belgian insurance system (IS) and society. The friction-cost method was used to estimate costs of lost productivity. Monetary values are reported in year-2003 euros (1.0 ∼ US $1.1 in 2003). Results: The expected success rate was 62.3% (95% CI, 60.1%--64.5%) for escitalopram compared with 57.2% (95% CI, 55.0%-59.4%) for citalopram. From the IS perspective, the expected cost per patient was 390 (95% CI, 372--409) for escitalopram compared with 411 (95 % CI, 391--431) for citalopram. From the societal perspective, these costs were 1162 (95% CI, 1106--1221) and 1276 (95% CI, 1216-1336), respectively. The success rates of venlafaxine (66.6% [95% CI, 64.2%-69.0%]) and escitalopram (67.0% [95% CI, 64.7%-69.4%]) were similar, but higher total costs were observed with venlafaxine, due to acquisition and secondary care costs. The use of data from various sources may have introduced bias. However, sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results of the model were robust. Conclusions: In this analysis, the treatment of MDDwith escitalopram appeared to be a cost-effective alternative compared with citalopram and venlafaxine, leading to better clinical outcomes and cost savings compared with citalopram in the model used. The success rates were similar between venlafaxine and escitalopram, but higher total costs were observed with venlafaxine. cost-effectiveness, severe, depression, escitalopram, Belgium",a cost effectiveness model of escitalopram citalopram and venlafaxine as first line treatment for major depressive disorder in belgium background economic evaluations aim to combinecosts and patient outcomes in one analysis objective the purpose of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of escitalopram vs all available competitors for first line treatment of major depressive disorder mdd in belgium methods a 2 path decision analytic model with a 6 month horizon was used all patients baseline scores on the montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs 18 to 40 started at the primary path and were referred to specialist care in the secondary care path model inputs included the following probabilities from a meta analysis of comparative trials data an ad hoc survey to evaluate pharmacologic treatment of depression in belgium literature and a panel of experts main outcome measures were success ie remission defined as madrs 12 and costs of treatment ie drug costs and medical care analyses were performed from the perspectives of the belgian insurance system is and society the friction cost method was used to estimate costs of lost productivity monetary values are reported in year 2003 euros 1 0 us 1 1 in 2003 results the expected success rate was 62 3 95 ci 60 1 64 5 for escitalopram compared with 57 2 95 ci 55 0 59 4 for citalopram from the is perspective the expected cost per patient was 390 95 ci 372 409 for escitalopram compared with 411 95 ci 391 431 for citalopram from the societal perspective these costs were 1162 95 ci 1106 1221 and 1276 95 ci 1216 1336 respectively the success rates of venlafaxine 66 6 95 ci 64 2 69 0 and escitalopram 67 0 95 ci 64 7 69 4 were similar but higher total costs were observed with venlafaxine due to acquisition and secondary care costs the use of data from various sources may have introduced bias however sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results of the model were robust conclusions in this analysis the treatment of mddwith escitalopram appeared to be a cost effective alternative compared with citalopram and venlafaxine leading to better clinical outcomes and cost savings compared with citalopram in the model used the success rates were similar between venlafaxine and escitalopram but higher total costs were observed with venlafaxine cost effectiveness severe depression escitalopram belgium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0
78,0,"Alteration in Estrogen Receptor α mRNA Levels in Frontal Cortex and Hippocampus of Patients with Major Mental Illness Background Gender differences have been described in major mental illnesses (MMI). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus are estrogen-sensitive brain regions structurally and functionally altered in patients with MMI. We hypothesized that gender-specific alterations in DLPFC and hippocampus estrogen receptor α (ERα) mRNA levels may exist in MMI patients. Methods We used Northern blot analysis to survey the expression of ERα mRNA transcripts in brain and body, detected by our human ERα riboprobe and in situ hybridization, to examine the expression pattern and quantify ERα mRNA levels in DLPFC and anterior hippocampus of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder compared with normal control subjects. Results Northern blotting revealed brain-region-specific differences in expression levels of a 5 kb ERα mRNA transcript. By in situ hybridization, ERα mRNA was detected in all layers of DLPFC and all hippocampal subfields in all subjects. We detected greater DLPFC ERα mRNA expression in male compared with female MDD subjects and reduced ERα mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus of schizophrenics compared with control subjects.

79,0,"Gender differences in posttraumatic stress disorderamong primary care patients after the World Trade Center attack of September 11, 2001 Background: Debate surrounds the nature of gender differences in rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: The goal of this study was to quantify and explore the reasons for gender differences in rates of PTSD in low income, primary care patients after the World Trade Center (WTC) attack of September 11, 2001. Methods: A survey was conducted at a large primary care practice in New York City 7 to 16 months after the WTC attack. The study involved a systematic sample of primary care patients aged 18 to 70 years. The main outcome measures were the Life Events Checklist, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire, all administered by a bilingual research staff. Results: A total of 3807 patients were approached at the primary care clinic. Of the 1347 who meteligibility criteria, 1157 (85.9%) consented to participate. After the addition of the WTC/PTSD supplement to the study, the total number of patients was 992, of whom 982 (99.0%) completed the survey. Both sexes had high rates of direct exposure to the WTC attack and high rates of lifetime exposure to stressful life events. Overall, females had lower rates of exposure to the attack compared with males (P < 0.05). Hispanic females had the highest rate of PTSD in the full sample. Gender differences in rates of PTSD were largely accounted for by differences in marital status and education. The rate of current major depressive disorder (MDD) was higher in females than in males (P < 0.001), and the reverse was true for substance abuse (P < 0.001). Gender differences for MDD and substance abuse persisted even after adjustments for demographic differences between the sexes. Conclusions: The increased rate of PTSD in women attending a primary care clinic was mediatedby their social and economic circumstances, such as living alone without a permanent relationship and with little education or income. The increased rate of MDD in women appeared to be less dependent on these circumstances. These findings have implications for the treatment of women with PTSD in primary care and for research on gender differences in rates of psychiatric disorders. posttraumatic stress disorder, gender, World Trade Center, primary care",gender differences in posttraumatic stress disorderamong primary care patients after the world trade center attack of september 11 2001 background debate surrounds the nature of gender differences in rates of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd objective the goal of this study was to quantify and explore the reasons for gender differences in rates of ptsd in low income primary care patients after the world trade center wtc attack of september 11 2001 methods a survey was conducted at a large primary care practice in new york city 7 to 16 months after the wtc attack the study involved a systematic sample of primary care patients aged 18 to 70 years the main outcome measures were the life events checklist the posttraumatic stress disorder checklist civilian version and the primary care evaluation of mental disorders patient health questionnaire all administered by a bilingual research staff results a total of 3807 patients were approached at the primary care clinic of the 1347 who meteligibility criteria 1157 85 9 consented to participate after the addition of the wtc ptsd supplement to the study the total number of patients was 992 of whom 982 99 0 completed the survey both sexes had high rates of direct exposure to the wtc attack and high rates of lifetime exposure to stressful life events overall females had lower rates of exposure to the attack compared with males p 0 05 hispanic females had the highest rate of ptsd in the full sample gender differences in rates of ptsd were largely accounted for by differences in marital status and education the rate of current major depressive disorder mdd was higher in females than in males p 0 001 and the reverse was true for substance abuse p 0 001 gender differences for mdd and substance abuse persisted even after adjustments for demographic differences between the sexes conclusions the increased rate of ptsd in women attending a primary care clinic was mediatedby their social and economic circumstances such as living alone without a permanent relationship and with little education or income the increased rate of mdd in women appeared to be less dependent on these circumstances these findings have implications for the treatment of women with ptsd in primary care and for research on gender differences in rates of psychiatric disorders posttraumatic stress disorder gender world trade center primary care,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0
80,0,"Escitalopram for comorbid depression and anxiety in elderly patients: A 12-week, open-label, flexible-dose, pilot trial Background: Comorbid depression and anxiety may result in greater symptom severity and poorer treatment response than either condition alone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been found to be effective in treating both depression and anxiety; however, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging warrant special attention in medication trials in older patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of short-term (12-week) administration of escitalopram oxalate 10 to 20 mg/d for moderate to marked comorbid depression and anxiety in elderly patients. Methods: This open-label, flexible-dose (10--20 mg/d), pilot trial was conducted at the Psychiatry Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio. Outpatients aged ≥65 years were included if they met the criteria for comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, for ≥4 weeks and had a baseline Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of >22 and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) score of ≥18. All patients received escitalopram 10 to 20 mg/d. The primary efficacy variables were the mean changes from baseline in total MADRS and HAM-A scores at 12 weeks (last observation carried forward). The secondary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 8 subscale scores. Adverse events were assessed at each visit (treatment weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) with the use of open-ended questioning. Results: Twenty patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 73.0 [4.8] years; 6 [30%] women; race: 17 [85%] white, 2 [10%] black, and 1 [5%] ``other''). Seventeen (85%) of 20 patients completed the study; 3 (15%) withdrew: 1 (5%) due to lack of efficacy and 2 (10%) due to adverse events (dizziness and somnolence [1 (5%) patient each]). Statistically significant improvements from baseline to end point were found with escitalopram treatment (MADRS: t19 = 7.38, P < 0.001, effect size = 2.93; HAM-A: t19 = 4.19, P < 0.001, effect size = 1.83).

Recent evidence, however, suggests that depressed patients consider factors beyond symptom resolution as important for defining remission. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of three predictors on patients' views of factors important for achieving remission: gender, age and current depressed state (i.e., remitted or depressed). Methods Five hundred and sixty-two depressed psychiatric outpatients completed a survey assessing the importance of 16 remission factors. Depressed state was assessed by the Standardized Clinical Outcome Rating scale for Depression (SCOR-D), a clinician rated scale that is based on the number of DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode and level of psychosocial impairment present during the past week. Results Relative to male patients, females showed a greater likelihood for rating remission factors related to emotional stabilization (e.g., achieving emotional control, being able to cope with normal stress) as very important. Relative to younger cohorts, the oldest depressed patients endorsed a greater number of remission factors as very important and emphasized positive mental health states (e.g., feeling satisfied, having a general sense of well-being) more. There were no significant differences between remitted and depressed patients in rating the remission factors' importance.

Thus, the data of a project as a whole is distributed over these tools. Therefore, it is necessary to make the relationships of different tool data repositories visible and keep them consistent with each other. This still is a nightmare due to the lack of domain-specific adaptable tool and data integration solutions which support maintenance of traceability links, semi-automatic consistency checking as well as update propagation. Currently used solutions are usually hand-coded one-way transformations between pairs of tools.

84,0,"Data fusion of high-resolution satellite imagery and LiDAR data for automatic building extraction This paper aims to present a new approach for automatic extraction of building footprints in a combination of the IKONOS imagery with pan-sharpened multi-spectral bands and the low-sampled (∼0.1 points/m2) airborne laser scanning data acquired from the Optech's 1020 ALTM (Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper). Initially, a laser point cluster in 3D object space was recognized as an isolated building object if all the member points were similarly attributed as building points by investigating the height property of laser points and the normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) driven from IKONOS imagery. As modelling cues, rectilinear lines around building outlines collected by either data-driven or model-driven manner were integrated in order to compensate the weakness of both methods. Finally, a full description of building outlines was accomplished by merging convex polygons, which were obtained as a building region was hierarchically divided by the extracted lines using the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree.

85,0,"Electronic source materials in clinical research: Acceptability and validity of symptom self-rating in major depressive disorder Objectives Clinical research projects gather large amounts of data. Typically, information is captured on paper source documents for later transcription to an electronic format, where responses can be checked, and errors, omissions, and inconsistencies can be resolved. These steps contribute delays, cost, and complexity to clinical research, particularly in large-scale multi-site investigations. To address these issues, we used a mobile computing device with a touch-screen display (``tablet PC'') to capture clinical data from depressed patients directly into electronic format. We then examined ease of use, the equivalence of responses between paper and electronic methods, and the acceptability of the tablet PC for this clinical population. Settings Outpatient clinics at four medical centers. Methods 80 adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) completed the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -- Self-Rated (QIDS-SR16), using both traditional paper forms and an electronic representation of the same questions; participants also completed a survey to evaluate their experience. Results QIDS-SR16 responses from paper and electronic versions were highly correlated (mean total: 15.3 (SD=5.2) electronic vs. 15.1 (SD=5.2) paper format), and showed high inter-rating reliability for overall score (intra-class correlation 0.987 (with a 95%CI [0.979,0.992])) and high degree of association for individual symptom items. Participants found both methods acceptable and overall found the electronic implementation easier to use. Conclusions QIDS-SR16 values collected electronically from research participants were equivalent to those collected using traditional paper self-assessment forms. Participants with MDD found the tablet PC version to be acceptable and easier to use than the paper forms.

86,0,"Serotonin-1A receptor imaging in recurrent depression: replication and literature review Introduction Serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1AR) function appears to be decreased in major depressive disorder (MDD) based on physiological responses to 5-HT1AR agonists in vivo and to 5-HT1AR binding in brain tissues postmortem or antemortem. We have previously assessed 5-HT1AR binding potential (BP) in depression using positron emission tomography (PET) and [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635, and we have demonstrated reduced 5-HT1AR BP in the mesiotemporal cortex (MTC) and raphe in depressives with primary recurrent familial mood disorders (n=12) versus controls (n=8) [Drevets WC, Frank E, Price JC, Kupfer DJ, Holt D, Greer PJ, Huang Y, Gautier C, Mathis C. PET imaging of serotonin 1A receptor binding in depression. Biol Psychiatry 1999;46(10):1375--87]. These findings were replicated by some, but not other, studies performed in depressed samples that were more generally selected using criteria for MDD. In the current study, we attempted to replicate our previous findings in an independent sample of subjects selected according to the criteria for primary recurrent depression applied in our prior study. Methods Using PET and [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635, 5-HT1AR BP was assessed in 16 depressed subjects and 8 healthy controls. Results Mean 5-HT1AR BP was reduced by 26% in the MTC (P<.005) and by 43% in the raphe (P<.001) in depressives versus controls. Conclusions These data replicate our original findings, which showed that BP was reduced by 27% in the MTC (P<.025) and by 42% in the raphe (P<.02) in depression. The magnitudes of these reductions in 5-HT1AR binding were similar to those found postmortem in 5-HT1AR mRNA concentrations in the hippocampus in MDD [López JF, Chalmers DT, Little KY, Watson SJ. Regulation of serotonin 1A, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptor in rat and human hippocampus: implications for neurobiology of depression. Biol Psychiatry 1998;43:547--73] and in 5-HT1AR-binding capacity in the raphe in depressed suicide victims [Arango V, Underwood MD, Boldrini M, Tamir H, Kassir SA, Hsiung S, Chen JJ, Mann JJ. Serotonin 1A receptors, serotonin transporter binding and serotonin transporter mRNA expression in the brainstem of depressed suicide victims. Neuropsychopharmacology 2001;25(6):892--903]. There exists disagreement within the literature, however, regarding the presence and direction of 5-HT1AR-binding abnormalities in depression, which may be explained in some cases by differences in anatomical location (e.g., [Stockmeier CA, Shapiro LA, Dilley GE, Kolli TN, Friedman L, Rajkowska G. Increase in serotonin-1A autoreceptors in the midbrain of suicide victims with major depression --- postmortem evidence for decreased serotonin activity. J Neurosci 1998;18(18):7394--401]) and in other cases by pathophysiological heterogeneity within MDD (e.g., some depressives hypersecrete cortisol, which would be expected to down-regulate 5-HT1AR expression [López JF, Chalmers DT, Little KY, Watson SJ. Regulation of serotonin 1A, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptor in rat and human hippocampus: implications for neurobiology of depression. Biol Psychiatry 1998;43:547--73]). Antidepressant drug treatment does not alter these abnormalities in 5-HT1AR binding [Sargent PA, Kjaer KH, Bench CJ, Rabiner EA, Messa C, Meyer J, Gunn RN, Grasby PM, Cowen PJ. Brain serotonin1A receptor binding measured by positron emission tomography with [11C]WAY-100635: effects of depression and antidepressant treatment.

88,0,"Dissociative experiences differentiate bipolar-II from unipolar depressed patients: The mediating role of cyclothymia and the Type A behaviour speed and impatience subscale Background Dissociative symptoms are often seen in patients with mood disorders, but there is little information on possible association with subgroups and temperamental features of these disorders. Methods The Dissociative Experience Scale was administered to 85 patients with a DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar-II Disorder (BP-II). Both broad-spectrum dissociation (DES total score) and clearly pathological forms of dissociation (DES-Taxon) were assessed. Temperament was assessed using Akiskal and Mallya`s criteria of Affective Temperaments and the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) for Type A Behaviour. Results Sixty-five patients gave valid answers to DES. The mean DES and DES-T scores were higher in BP-II (16.8 and 12.7 respectively) compared to MDD (9.0 and 5.7); DES odds ratio (OR)=1.58 (95% CI 1.15--2.18) and DES-T OR=1.60 (95% CI 1.14--2.25) using univariate logistic regression analyses. There was no significant difference in DES score in patients with (n=30) and without an affective temperament (n=35): mean (95% CI), 13.5 vs. 10.5 (−7.8 to 1.9), p=0.224. However the subgroup with a cyclothymic temperament (n=18) had higher DES scores (mean (95% CI): 17.8 vs. 9.7 (2.9--13.3), p=0.003), compared to patients without such a temperament. There was no significant difference in DES scores for patients with (n=35) or without (n=28) a Type A behaviour pattern (JAS>0): mean (95% CI) 12. 7 vs. 10.9 (−6.8 to 3.3), p=0.491), but a positive JAS factor S score (speed and impatience subscale) was associated with significantly higher DES scores than a negative S-score: mean (95% CI) 14.9 vs. 9.0 (1.1--10.7), p=0.017), and this was still significant (p=0.005) using multiple linear regression of DES scores vs. the JAS subscale scores. DES-T scores were significantly higher in patients with OCD (n=9) (mean (95% CI) 18.4 vs. 6.6 (6.0--17.7), p<0.001); eating disorder (n=13) (14.0 vs. 6.8 (1.8--12.6), p=0.009), psychotic symptoms during depressions (n=9) (16.6 vs. 6.9 (3.7--15.8), p=0.002), and in those with a history of suicide attempt (n=28) (11.9 vs. 5.4 (2.2--10.8), p=0.003), but only OCD was an independent predictor after multiple linear regression of DES-T scores vs. all co-morbid disorders (p=0.043). Limitations The major limitation of the present study is a non-blind evaluation of affective diagnosis and temperaments, and assessment in a non-remission clinical status.

89,0,"The selegiline transdermal system in major depressive disorder: A systematic review of safety and tolerability Background Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are highly efficacious antidepressants, but safety concerns have limited their broad use. Methods We reviewed key safety and tolerability data from all clinical trials of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) accrued during the clinical development of the selegiline transdermal system (STS), as reported to the Food and Drug Administration. This review includes data from both controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials involving STS-treated (n=2036) and placebo-treated (n=668) patients. Results Except for the initial trial, subsequent trials, which involved STS doses ranging from 3 mg/24 h to 12 mg/24 h, lacked tyramine restrictions, and no acute hypertensive reactions occurred during study treatment. Safety experience with STS 6 mg/24 h supports this therapeutic dose without tyramine dietary modifications, but until more data are available for STS doses 9 mg/24 h and 12 mg/24 h, foods that are rich sources of tyramine should be avoided. The principal side effects of STS therapy were local dermal reactions and insomnia, both of which were dose-related. Side effects associated with MAOI treatment, such as sexual dysfunction and excessive weight gain, were uncommon. Conclusions A comprehensive review of safety from the clinical development program suggests that the STS is safe and well tolerated, with an improved safety margin compared with orally administered MAOIs.

90,0,"Childhood Predictors of Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Results from the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative Background Although it is known that childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood, childhood predictors of this persistence have not been widely studied. Methods Childhood history of ADHD and adult ADHD were assessed in 10 countries in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. Logistic regression analysis was used to study associations of retrospectively reported childhood risk factors with adult persistence among the 629 adult respondents with childhood ADHD. Risk factors included age; sex; childhood ADHD symptom profiles, severity, and treatment; comorbid child/adolescent DSM-IV disorders; childhood family adversities; and child/adolescent exposure to traumatic events. Results An average of 50% of children with ADHD (range: 32.8%--84.1% across countries) continued to meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD as adults. Persistence was strongly related to childhood ADHD symptom profile (highest persistence associated with the attentional plus impulsive-hyperactive type, odds ratio [OR] = 12.4, compared with the lowest associated with the impulsive-hyperactive type), symptom severity (OR = 2.0), comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD; OR = 2.2), high comorbidity (≥3 child/adolescent disorders in addition to ADHD; OR = 1.7), paternal (but not maternal) anxiety mood disorder (OR = 2.4), and parental antisocial personality disorder (OR = 2.2). A multivariate risk profile of these variables significantly predicts persistence of ADHD into adulthood (area under the receiving operator characteristic curve = .76). Conclusions A substantial proportion of children with ADHD continue to meet full criteria for ADHD as adults.

91,0,"Evaluation of docosahexaenoic acid deficiency as a preventable risk factor for recurrent affective disorders: Current status, future directions, and dietary recommendations Major recurrent affective disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, represent a growing public health crisis in the United States. Evidence from cross-national and cross-sectional epidemiological surveys, comparative peripheral and central composition studies, and placebo-controlled intervention trials suggest that n-3 fatty acid deficiency may contribute to the pathoaetiology of affective disorders. These data are reviewed with the objective of estimating a daily docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) intake value that is projected to be efficacious in mitigating vulnerability. It is proposed that daily DHA intake sufficient to increase erythrocyte DHA composition to a level found in healthy subjects from Japan (7%), where the lifetime prevalence rates of MDD and bipolar disorder are several fold lower than the US, represents an appropriate target. To achieve this target, preliminary DHA intervention trials indicate that a daily dose of 400--700mg/d in children and 700--1000mg/d in adults would be required. Based on the results of placebo-controlled intervention trials, a higher daily DHA dose in the order of 1000--1500mg/d in a 2:1 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3):DHA ratio may be optimal for the treatment of established affective disorders. These recommendations are intended to guide future dose-ranging placebo-controlled DHA intervention trials in patients with established affective disorders, as well as in asymptomatic subjects at elevated risk for developing affective disorders. Such early intervention studies are currently feasible and will ultimately be required to definitively evaluate whether DHA is a required nutrient for the prevention of affective disorders.

92,0,"Public stigma in health and non-healthcare students: Attributions, emotions and willingness to help with adolescent self-harm Background For people who self-harm, there is growing evidence to suggest that services and treatment outcomes can be adversely affected by healthcare staffs' stigmatising attitudes and behaviours. To date, the empirical literature has tended to focus on the attitudes of experienced healthcare professionals working with adults who self-harm. Additionally, there has been few theory or model-driven studies to help identify what healthcare students think and feel about young people who self-harm. Objectives The aim of the present study was to explore the way healthcare and non-healthcare students think and feel about adolescent self-harm behaviour using Corrigan et al.'s [Corrigan, P.W., Markowitz, F.E., Watson, A., Rowan, D., Kubiak, M.A., 2003. An attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness. Journal of Health and Social Behaviour 44, 162--179] attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness. Design The study was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional, survey that consisted of two hypothetical vignettes. Settings Two universities in England, United Kingdom. Participants One hundred and eighty-four final-year students, covering health (medicine, nursing, clinical psychology) and non-health care (physics) professions. Methods Students were presented with vignettes describing a young female who self-harms. Attributions of controllability were experimentally manipulated across the vignette conditions and students were asked to complete self-report questionnaires measuring attitudes towards self-harm, familiarity with self-harm and social desirability. Results Consistent with the public discrimination model, students who believed that a young person was responsible for their self-harm reported higher feelings of anger towards them. Anger, in turn, was associated with a belief in the manipulatory nature of the self-harm and with less willingness to help. Perceived risk was found to be associated with higher levels of anxiety and increased support for the use of coercive and segregatory strategies to manage self-harming behaviour. Gender and student type were important influences on public stigma, with both men and medical students reporting more negative attitudes towards self-harm. Conclusions This study provides evidence that a number of factors may adversely affect the care and treatment received by young people who self-harm, namely: students' causal attributions, the gender and profession of healthcare students, and familiarity with self-harm behaviour. To improve the effectiveness of service provision and treatment outcomes for people who self-harm, it is important that health care service providers and teaching institutions consider the implications of these factors when developing staff and services, and base interventions on theoretical models of stigma and discrimination.

93,0,"Data acquisition system implemented with various platforms for KSTAR diagnostic systems For the 1st plasma operation of the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) in 2008, 11 diagnostic systems had been developed such as five types of magnetic diagnostics, millimeter-wave interferometer, ECE radiometer, visible survey spectrometer, H_alpha monitor, filter scope and visible/H-alpha TVs to measure basic physics data; plasma current, electron density, temperature, plasma image, impurity, and so on. Data acquisition (DAQ) systems for those diagnostics performed signal conditioning, conversion from analog signal to digital signal with specific bit resolution, and data transmission in synchronized manner. A feature of the KSTAR diagnostic DAQ systems is that the systems have been implemented with various platforms for maximum hardware efficiency, future extendibility and adaptability to diagnostic systems. Another feature is that all diagnostic DAQ systems have been integrated into KSTAR central control system with EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) to configure and monitor them. In addition, all diagnostic DAQ systems operate in a synchronized manner by using local timing units (LTU) which are connected to a central timing unit (CTU) in the KSTAR time & synchronization system (TSS) via a dedicated timing network. Finally, diagnostic data generated during a shot are transferred to a centralized storage system using MDSplus (Model Driven System plus) which is an open source tool to be used widely in fusion environment.

94,0,"Frequency of psychological and somatic symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most commonly encountered psychiatric disorders in primary care. Depression is primarily a psychological illness; however, patients usually present with somatic symptoms. This pattern of presentation quite often poses a risk for patients with MDD due to the fact that general practitioners commonly attribute the cause of somatic symptoms to organic illnesses, thereby misdiagnosing patients. The current study focuses on the frequency of psychological and somatic symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder. The study is a cross-sectional survey using non-probability purposive sampling technique. The authors administered a self-developed questionnaire on 900 patients (male and female) diagnosed with major depressive disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-TR (DSM-IV-TR). The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences-10 (SPSS-10). Females presented with a higher frequency of somatic symptoms as compared to psychological symptoms, whereas males presented with a higher frequency of psychological symptoms as compared to somatic symptoms. These findings emphasize the imperative need for health care professionals to have a thorough understanding of major depressive disorder. The disabling effects of depression can be minimized and prognosis of such patients improved to the point of remission if depression is promptly diagnosed without ambiguity, and intensively treated based on the physician's comprehensive knowledge of the symptomatology of major depressive disorder.

96,0,"Treatment-seeking behaviours for depression in the general population: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Background In light of the public health and clinical significance of major depression, treatment utilisation is an important issue. Epidemiological data is particularly useful for yielding accurate estimates of national trends; assessing unmet need in the population; and, informing mental health policy and focused planning of public health prevention and intervention programs. Methods Based on data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), latent class analysis (LCA) was used to empirically identify and validate a typology of treatment-seeking behaviours for depression. Analyses were based on a subsample of individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Results A three-class solution emerged as the best-fitting model. The classes were labelled highly active treatment-seeking, partially active treatment-seeking, and inactive treatment-seeking. The classes were validated by reference to predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with treatment utilisation. Limitations Since information was retrieved by retrospective self-report it was not possible to corroborate information on treatment utilisation or medical conditions with independent clinical or administrative records. Reporting bias and recall error therefore cannot be ruled out. Also, given that the NESARC utilised lay interviewer-administered structured interviews to determine mental health diagnoses, one should be mindful that diagnoses are epidemiological research diagnoses rather than clinician diagnoses.

A classification framework has been developed, in order to aid the model based software construction by categorizing research problems related to consistency. However, the framework does not include information on the importance of classification elements. Objective The aim was to extend the classification framework with information about the relative importance of the elements constituting the classification. The research question was how to express and obtain this information. Method A survey was conducted on a sample of 24 stakeholders from academia and industry, with different roles, who answered a quantitative questionnaire. Specifically, the respondents prioritized perspectives and issues using an extended hierarchical voting scheme based on the hundred dollar test. The numerical data obtained were first weighted and normalized and then they were analyzed by descriptive statistics and bar charts. Results The detailed analysis of the data revealed the relative importance of consistency perspectives and issues under different views, allowing for the desired extension of the classification framework with empirical information. The most highly valued issues come from the pragmatics perspective.

99,0,"The impact of brief depressive episodes on the outcome of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder: A 1-year prospective study Background Brief depressive episodes (BDEs) cause psychosocial impairment and increased risk of suicide, worsening the outcome and long-term course of affective disorders. The aim of this naturalistic observational study was to assess the frequency of BDEs and very brief depressive episodes (VBDEs) and their impact on clinical outcome in a sample of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Method Seventy patients with a diagnosis of MDD or BD were followed up and monthly visited for a period of 12months, assessing the eventual occurrence of BDEs and/or VBDEs. Clinical and demographic variables of the total sample and of the groups divided according to the presence of BDEs or VBDEs were collected and compared by one-way ANOVAs. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 items (HDRS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clinical Global Impression (severity of illness) (CGIs) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36-item 1) were administered at baseline and logistic regression was performed to evaluate whether baseline scores were predictive of the onset of BDEs or VBDEs. Results BDEs (88.6% of the total sample), VBDEs (44.3% of the total sample) and BDEs+VBDEs (40.0% of the total sample) were found to occur frequently across the sample. BDE patients showed more death thoughts during major depressive episodes (χ2=4.14, df=1, p=0.04, Phi=0.24) compared to patients without BDEs. Indeed VBDE patients showed a higher rate of hospitalization (χ2=5.71, df=1, p=0.031, phi=0.29), a more frequent prescription of a combined treatment (χ2=13.07, df=7, p=0.03, phi=0.43) and higher scores at SF-36 item 1 (F=6.65, p=0.01) compared to patients without VBDEs. Finally, higher SF-36 item 1 scores were found to be predictive of VBDEs (odds ratio=2.81, p=0.03).

Because GAD and the experience of racial discrimination are both associated with symptoms of worry and tension, we expected race based discrimination to predict GAD prevalence for African Americans, but not other groups. We did not expect non-race based discrimination to predict GAD. Results showed that while more frequent experiences of non-race based discrimination predicted GAD for all groups, experiencing race based discrimination was associated with significantly higher odds of endorsing lifetime GAD for African Americans only.

Looking for new medications that can potentiate the effects of current antidepressants seems to be necessary. Our objective is to survey the efficacy of topiramate augmentation in resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Method This augmentation trial was designed as an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Fifty three patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD who had failed to respond to at least 8weeks of treatment with an adequate dose of one of the SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram or serteraline) were included in the study. Patients were randomized to receive a flexible dose of topiramate (100--200mg/day) or placebo beside their current antidepressant medication for a period of eight weeks. Outcome measures were Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Results 42 patients completed the study and there were 6 and 5 dropouts in topiramate and placebo groups, respectively. The topiramate group demonstrated significant improvement over the study period based on mean HAM-D score at week 8 compared to baseline (P=.000, Z=3.699). Those receiving topiramate demonstrated to have a mean decrease of 32.0% in HAM-D score, compared to only 5.5% for those receiving placebo. Depressed mood, suicidality, insomnia (early, middle and late), agitation and anxiety symptoms were significantly improved in the topiramate group. Conclusion Our double-blind placebo-controlled study demonstrated that topiramate augmentation potentiate the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treatment of resistant major depressive disorder.

102,0,"Analysis of Depression in Asthmatic Patients Using the Japanese Version of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ABSTRACT Background Previous studies show that depression plays an important role in asthma. However, the association between asthma control and severity, and depression is inconclusive. Methods To investigate the association between asthma control and severity, and depression, we assessed differences in asthma control and asthma severity between groups with various grades of depressive state as defined by the PHQ-9 score using data from the Japanese version of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (J-PHQ-9) and a questionnaire survey including the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Results The ACT scores in the symptom-screen positive (SP) and major/other depressive disorder (MDD/ ODD) group were significantly lower than those in the symptom-screen negative (SN) and non-MDD/ODD groups, respectively. The rate of step1 and of step 3 and 4 in the SP group were significantly lower and higher than those in the SN group, respectively. When the SP group was divided into three, that is minimal, mild, and more than mild (MTM) depressive state subgroups, the ACT scores in the mild and MTM depressive state subgroups were significantly lower than those in the minimal depressive state subgroup. When the MTM subgroup was divided into moderate, moderate-severe and severe depressive state groups, however, there was no significant variation in ACT score and asthma severity among these three depressive state groups. Conclusions This study is the first, large-scale investigation of the use of the J-PHQ-9 in asthma patients. Using the J-PHQ-9 and the questionnaire, there was a clear association between asthma control and severity, and depression. As the depression became more severe, the existence of other depression-associated factors unrelated to asthma control and severity might be assumed, although further investigation will be required.

103,0,"Differences between effects of psychological versus pharmacological treatments on functional and morphological brain alterations in anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder: A systematic review The most prevalent mental disorders, anxiety and mood disorders, are associated with both functional and morphological brain changes that commonly involve the `fear network' including the (medial) prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Patients suffering from anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder often show excessive amygdala and reduced prefrontal cortex functioning. It is, however, still unclear whether these brain abnormalities disappear or diminish following effective treatment. This review aims to compare the effects of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy on functional and morphological brain measures in these disorders. Sixty-three studies were included, 30 investigating psychotherapy effects and 33 investigating pharmacotherapy effects. Despite methodological differences, results suggest a functional normalization of the `fear network'. Pharmacotherapy particularly decreases over-activity of limbic structures (bottom-up effect) while psychotherapy tends to increase activity and recruitment of frontal areas (top-down effect), especially the anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, pharmacotherapy, but not psychotherapy, has been associated with morphological changes, depending on the disorder. These findings suggest that both types of treatments normalize (functional) brain abnormalities each in specific ways.

Most antidepressant drugs have a positive effect on mood but do not treat the cognitive dysfunctions or even aggravate the symptoms. In this review we will evaluate the association between mood and cognition in the context of mood disorders. In the first section we will summarize the brain circuits at the intersection between cognition and emotion, highlighting the role of the hippocampus. In the second section, we will survey the contribution of the glutamate and GABA systems in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, making an effort to understand the link between emotions and cognition and how novel therapeutic approaches deal with them. In the third section we will explore the monoamine involvement in the emotion/cognition duality in the context of mood disorders.

Nilsson offers a high-level programming model that permits the development of reactive systems, such as robotic vehicles. Teleo-Reactive programs are written in a manner that allows engineers to define the behaviour of the system while taking into account goals and changes in the state of the environment. This article presents a systematic approach that makes it possible to derive architectural models, with structural descriptions and behaviour, from Teleo-Reactive Programs. The development of reactive systems can therefore benefit significantly from a combination of two approaches: (1) the Teleo-Reactive approach, which is oriented towards a description of the system from the standpoint of the goals identified and the state of the environment and (2) the architectural approach, which is oriented towards the design of component-based software, in which decisions are conditioned by the need to reuse already tested solutions. The integration of this work into a development environment that allows code to be generated via model transformations opens up new possibilities in the development of this type of systems.

Methods Cross-sectional postal survey on the ``Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale'' (MGEN) policyholders. A self-rated questionnaire was sent by mail to 20,099 individuals randomly selected among MGEN policyholders. Tools: questionnaire on socio-demographic variables and health-care use; Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ); Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form Self-Administered (CIDI-SA). Results Responders were 10,288 (53%). The prevalence of MDQ positivity (MDQ+) was 3.6%. The respondents older than 65 showed the lowest frequencies. High frequencies were recorded by the people who had left work because of long term sickness and by people with invalidity. Subjects having a diagnosis of ICD-10 major depression were found to be at risk. Positive subjects had no more contacts with general practitioners than negative subjects; on the contrary they had more contacts with psychiatrists, alternative medicine professionals, psychologists, psychoanalysts, spiritual guides or welfare workers. MDQ+ subjects had a higher risk to use all kinds of psychodrugs, including antidepressants (27.7%, OR=2.7, CI95% 1.9--3.9). Discussion The prevalence of MDQ+ was similar to the surveys in the USA and Italy.

This heterogeneity hinders the ability of molecular genetic research to reliably detect the small effects conferred by common genetic variation. As a result, significant research efforts have been directed at investigating more homogenous intermediate phenotypes believed to be more proximal to gene function and lie between genes and/or environmental effects and disease processes. In the current review we survey and integrate research on two promising intermediate phenotypes linked to depression: reward processing and stress sensitivity. A synthesis of this burgeoning literature indicates that a molecular genetic approach focused on intermediate phenotypes holds significant promise to fundamentally improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of depression, which will be required for improved diagnostic definitions and the development of novel and more efficacious treatment and prevention strategies.

The topic of system adaptivity has been widely studied since the mid-60s and, over the past decade, several application areas and technologies relating to self-adaptivity have assumed greater importance. In all these initiatives, software has become the common element that introduces self-adaptability. Thus, the investigation of systematic software engineering approaches is necessary, in order to develop self-adaptive systems that may ideally be applied across multiple domains. The main goal of this study is to review recent progress on self-adaptivity from the standpoint of computer sciences and cybernetics, based on the analysis of state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. This review provides an over-arching, integrated view of computer science and software engineering foundations.

110,0,"Risk for suicidal behaviors associated with PTSD, depression, and their comorbidity in the U.S. Army Background Suicide rates have risen considerably in the United States Army in the past decade. Suicide risk is highest among those with past suicidality (suicidal ideation or attempts). The incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive illnesses has risen concurrently in the U.S. Army. We examined the relationship of PTSD and depression, independently and in combination, and rates of past-year suicidality in a representative sample of U.S. Army soldiers. Methods This study used the DoD Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel (DoD HRB) (N=5927). Probable PTSD and depression were assessed with the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and the 10-item short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Past-year suicidality was assessed via self-report. Results Six percent of Army service members reported suicidality within the past year. PTSD and MDD were each independently associated with past-year suicidality. Soldiers with both disorders were almost three times more likely to report suicidality within the past year than those with either diagnosis alone. Population-attributable risk proportions for PTSD, depression, and both disorders together were 24%, 29%, and 45%, respectively. Limitations The current study is subject to the limitations of a cross-sectional survey design and the self-report nature of the instruments used. Conclusions PTSD and depression are each associated with suicidality independently and in combination in the active duty component of the U.S. Army. Soldiers presenting with either but especially both disorders may require additional outreach and screening to decrease suicidal ideation and attempts.

111,0,"The Detectability of Free-phase Migrating CO2: A Rock Physics and Seismic Modelling Feasibility Study Subsurface monitoring is essential for the successful implementation and public acceptance of CO2 storage. Injected CO2 will need to be monitored to verify the successful containment within its intended formation, and to ensure no loss of containment within the storage complex. The ability for seismic techniques to monitor structurally trapped CO2 has been successfully demonstrated due to the changes in the acoustic properties of the reservoir produced by the displacement of brine by less dense and more compressible CO2. However, the ability for seismic methods to detect free-phase migrating CO2 is still moderately understood. In order to assess the feasibility for seismic monitoring of a migrating front, we estimate the time-lapse signal over a theoretical, clean, homogeneous sandstone reservoir through the application of a three-stage model-driven workflow consisting of fluid-flow, rock physics and seismic forward modelling. To capture the range of responses which could be encountered, two end-member fluid distribution models were used: uniform saturation and the modified patchy saturation model. Analysis of the time- lapse survey highlights the importance of determining and understanding the fluid distribution model impacting the range of velocities prior to generating and interpreting the seismic response. This change in velocity is shown to be directly related to the volume of CO2 occupying the pore-space of a migrating plume front. This highlights the fact that the detectability of a migrating front is a site specific issue which not only depends on the geophysical parameters of the seismic survey but also on the geological variations and spatial distribution in the reservoir.

112,0,"A comprehensive modeling framework for role-based access control policies Prohibiting unauthorized access to critical resources and data has become a major requirement for enterprises; access control (AC) mechanisms manage requests from users to access system resources. One of the most used AC paradigms is role-based access control (RBAC), in which access rights are determined based on the user's role. Many different types of RBAC policies have been proposed in the literature, each one accompanied by the corresponding extension of the original RBAC model. However, there is no unified framework that can be used to define all these types of policies in a coherent way, using a common model. In this paper we propose a model-driven engineering approach, based on UML and the Object Constraint Language (OCL), to enable the precise specification and verification of such policies. More specifically, we first present a taxonomy of the various types of RBAC policies proposed in the literature. We also propose the GemRBAC model, a generalized model for RBAC that includes all the entities required to define the classified policies. This model is a conceptual model that can also serve as data model to operationalize data collection and verification.

The objective of the present study was to present prevalence, correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, treatment and disability of NMPOU and DSM-5 NMPOUD among men and women. Methods Nationally representative sample of the U.S. Results Prevalences of 12-month and lifetime NMPOU were greater among men (4.4%, 13.0%) than women (3.9%, 9.8%), while corresponding rates of DSM-5 NMPOUD did not differ between men (0.9%, 2.2%) and women (0.9%, 1.9%). Regardless of time frame and sex, NMPOU and NMPOUD generally decreased with age and were lower among Blacks, Asians/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics, and respondents with lower socioeconomic status. Among men with NMPOU, rates were lower among respondents in the Northeast and South and among those previously married (lifetime). Across time frames and gender, NMPOU and NMPOUD were generally associated with other substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress and borderline, schizotypal and antisocial personality disorders, but associated with major depressive disorder, persistent depression and bipolar I disorder only among men. Disability increased with NMPOU frequency and NMPOUD severity. Only 7.6% and 8.2% of men and women with NMPOU ever received treatment, while 26.8% and 31.1% ever received treatment for NMPOUD. Conclusions NMPOU and NMPOUD are highly disabling, associated with a broad array of sex-specific and shared correlates and comorbidities and largely go untreated in the U.S. Valid assessment tools are needed that include gender as a stratification variable to identify NMPOU and NMPOUD.

114,0,"Mapping patient path in the Pediatric Emergency Department: A workflow model driven approach The workflow models of the patient journey in a Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) seems to be an effective approach to develop an accurate and complete representation of the PED processes. This model can drive the collection of comprehensive quantitative and qualitative service delivery and patient treatment data as an evidence base for the PED service planning. Our objective in this study is to identify crowded situation indicators and bottlenecks that contribute to over-crowding. The greatest source of delay in patient flow is the waiting time from the health care request, and especially the bed request to exit from the PED for hospital admission. It represented 70% of the time that these patients occupied in the PED waiting rooms. The use of real data to construct the workflow model of the patient path is effective in identifying sources of delay in patient flow, and aspects of the PED activity that could be improved. The development of this model was based on accurate visits made in the PED of the Regional University Hospital Center (CHRU) of Lille (France).

Methods The SCARED was administered to 76 hospice-patient caregivers (e.g., family members). Major depressive disorder (MDD) was diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV; complicated grief (CG) ``caseness'' was diagnosed with the Inventory of Complicated Grief--Caregiver items, and quality-of-life domains were assessed with the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form--36. Results Respondents endorsed frequent exposure to each SCARED experience---from 30.3% who mistakenly thought the patient had died, to 80.3% who witnessed the patient in severe pain. Adjusted analyses revealed that the odds of MDD increased by 3.08 for each standard-deviation increase in the SCARED event frequency score and that higher SCARED scores were positively associated (p <0.05) with social and role impairment, less energy, and more negative health perceptions.

Background: Numerous studies have shown improved functioning after a depression, but often substantial limitations at follow-up remained. The goal of this study is to examine (1) whether functioning returns to pre-morbid levels after a major depressive episode (MDE), (2) predictors of incomplete functional recovery, and (3) how these functional levels relate to those in a non-depressed sample. Methods: Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study, a prospective general population study with three waves. Psychopathology was measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and functioning with the Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). One hundred and sixty-five individuals who met criteria for MDE between baseline and third wave, but not in the 12 months preceding baseline and third wave were selected. Results: Mean post-morbid levels of functioning did not differ from pre-morbid levels although this level still differed significantly from the non-depressed sample. Sixty to eighty-five percent of the respondents did better or showed no change on different scales after recovery from MDE. Co-morbid substance use disorder and anxiety disorder, presence of somatic illness, external mastery, low social support and high baseline functioning were predictors of worsened functioning. Limitations: Lay interviewers used fully structured diagnostic interviews to determine MDE and functioning was measured using self-report. Conclusions: In general, people who recover from a MDE will also recover from functional impairments.

We computed descriptive statistics on rates of depressive symptoms and probable MDD, evaluated internal consistency and construct validity, and analyzed the accuracy of individual items as predictors of MDD. Results Exactly 11.4% of participants met criteria for probable MDD. Probable MDD was associated with poorer subjective health, lower satisfaction with life, and more difficulty in daily role functioning. Probable MDD was not related to most demographic or injury-related variables. Both somatic and psychologic symptoms predicted probable MDD. Conclusions The PHQ-9 has promise as a tool with which to identify probable MDD in people with SCI. Somatic symptoms should be counted toward the diagnosis and should alert health care providers to the likelihood of MDD. More efficient screening is only one of the quality improvement efforts needed to enhance management of MDD.

120,0,"Is current alcohol consumption associated with increased lifetime prevalence of major depression and suicidality? Results from a pilot community survey Objective Alcohol use disorders are associated with increased illness severity and suicidality in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about how alcohol use across the continuum relates to MDD. Method Subjects were 496 adults (201 men, 295 women) who completed a community-based telephone survey that incorporated a validated structured diagnostic interview for depression and a validated alcohol questionnaire. Subjects were divided into 3 alcohol consumption groups based on Canadian low-risk drinking guidelines: minimal (MIN), moderate (MOD), and heavy (HVY) alcohol consumption. Results Among subjects with MDD, drinking group was not associated with measures of disability, health service use, or life satisfaction. Among all women, the prevalence of depression increased significantly across drinking groups (MIN, 24.6%; MOD, 30.3%; HVY, 44.0% [linear-by-linear association χ2 = 4.1, df = 1, P < .05]), as did the prevalence of suicidality among women with MDD (MIN, 16.3%; MOD, 29.6%; HVY, 45.5% [χ2 = 4.5, df = 1, P < .05]).

Method A cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of students (n=2658) in six colleges in Osun state, Western Nigeria. The students were independently assessed for ARP and MDD with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results The current (2 weeks) prevalence of MDD in college students with alcohol dependence is 23.8%; alcohol abuse 17.2% and hazardous use 12.4%. Compared with total abstainers, major depressive disorder is significantly more likely to be associated with diagnosis of alcohol dependence (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.42--6.96), alcohol abuse (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.38--3.72) and hazardous use (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12--2.38), but less associated with alcohol users without ARP (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.69--1.25).

Method Women seeking prenatal care completed a screening survey (including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale) in several hospital-based obstetrics clinics. Women identified as high risk for depression completed diagnostic interviews (n=276) during pregnancy, consisting of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, measures of depression symptom severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II), health functioning (SF-36) and current and past psychiatric treatment. Results Among women with a current MDD diagnosis, most of whom were experiencing a recurrence, 33% were currently receiving any depression treatment. The presence of current MDD was not found to be related to use of treatment. Prior history of MDD, history of psychiatric treatment and depression severity were significant predictors of depression treatment during pregnancy. Conclusions Most women with current MDD were found to be either untreated or suboptimally treated, and prenatal MDD was not predictive of treatment.

Method Random digit dialing methodology was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of 4023 adolescents, ages 12--17. Telephone surveys, conducted in 1995, assessed demographics, parental substance use, violence exposure, and three psychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder (MDE), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse/dependence (SA/D). Results Obtained prevalence rates included: 8.2% for sexual assault, 22.5% for physical assault, and 39.7% for witnessing violence at home or in the community. Substance use by a family member was reported by 18.4% (n=721) of adolescents, with 50.6% reporting parental alcohol use and 19.1% (n=138) reporting parental drug use. Consistent with hypotheses, violence exposure and parental substance use, particularly parental alcohol abuse, were independently associated with outcomes. Additionally, parental substance use emerged as a moderator for MDE, PTSD, and SA/D; however, the moderating relations varied according to the outcome variable investigated.

It was hypothesized that patients with MDD would exhibit lower frontal cortical concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the principal omega-3 fatty acid in brain, relative to normal controls. Methods We determined the total fatty acid composition of postmortem orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann's Area 10) from patients with DSM-IV-defined MDD (n = 15) and age-matched normal controls (n = 27) by gas chromatography. Results After correction for multiple comparisons, the omega-3 fatty acid DHA was the only fatty acid that was significantly different (−22%) in the postmortem orbitofrontal cortex of MDD patients relative to normal controls. Deficits in DHA concentrations were greater in female MDD patients (−32%) than in male MDD patients (−16%), and could not be wholly attributed to lifestyle factors or postmortem tissue variables. Conclusions These results demonstrate a selective deficit in the omega-3 fatty acid DHA in the orbitofrontal cortex of patients with MDD. This finding adds to a growing body of evidence implicating omega-3 fatty acid deficiency as well as the orbitofrontal cortex in the pathophysiology and potentially pathogenesis of MDD.

The lifetime prevalence rates of DSM-III major depressive disorder (females 2.44% and males 1.29%) in that study do not tally with several indices of worsened social health and clinical prevalence studies of depression in contemporary Hong Kong. Methods Each of 5004 adults randomly drawn from the general population completed a telephone interview that generated the DSM-IV-based diagnosis of major depressive episode (MDE), sociodemography, help-seeking, and other epidemiological data. Results Twelve-month prevalence of MDE was 8.4%. The female-to-male ratio was low but typical of surveys in Chinese communities. Female sex and unemployment were associated with increased risk. 32.5% of respondents with MDE reported frequent thoughts of suicide. Recognition of the need for treatment of depression was high but actual treatment rate and preference for mental health specialists were low. Limitations Response rate was low though cooperation rate was moderately high. Detailed demography, comorbidity, and clinical reappraisal interviews were not covered. Conclusions Resolving issues of stigma and mode of symptom elicitation may lead to more valid prevalence estimates of depression among Chinese people. Although longitudinal studies are needed to confirm a genuine increase in prevalence, depression is likely to be more common in Hong Kong than previously suggested.

130,0,"The association of major depressive episodes with income inequality and the human development index The aim of this study was to estimate the association between country income distribution and human development with the 12-month occurrence of major depressive episodes across countries. A total of 251,158 people surveyed by the World Health Organization from 2002 to 2003 from 65 countries were included in the study. The survey contained items for identifying major depressive episodes (MDE) in the previous 12 months, attained education (used as an indicator of individual socioeconomic status) and other demographic information. Income inequality was measured with the Gini index, a national-level indicator; the United Nations human development index (HDI) measured overall country development. Country-level and multilevel linear regression models were utilized to study the associations. We found that moderately developed countries had the lowest adjusted prevalence of MDE followed by high and low developed countries. The Gini index was positively associated with major depressive episodes, but only among high HDI countries. After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, education and HDI, the multilevel prevalence ratio indicated a 4% increase in risk of MDE for a person living in a country associated with a 1% increment in income equality. This finding means, for example, that comparing two highly developed countries, one with low income inequality (Gini=0.25) with another with high income inequality (Gini=0.39), one would expect to see an increase in the prevalence of MDE from 4.0% to 6.2%.

Methods Analyses are based on 1982 subjects (14 to 24 years at baseline) without baseline MDE who participated during the whole study period and for whom diagnostic information about psychopathology in both parents was available. The offspring's familial depression liability was determined by aggregating information on parental depressive symptoms obtained from family history data and direct interviews with parents. Data were assessed with the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview according to its DSM-IV algorithms. Results Adverse events predicted a substantially increased incidence of MDE among respondents with familial liability but not in those without familial liability. There was a significant interaction between familial liability and traumatic events with the strongest effect for the number of severe traumatic events (risk difference = 11.3%; 95% confidence interval = 3.55--19.15). Associations with familial liability were most pronounced for separation events. Conclusions Adverse events are particularly pathogenic in individuals with familial liability. The involvement of interactions and correlations between familial liability and adversity might depend on type, severity, and number of events.

Classification, Burden and Principles of Management Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most burdensome illnesses in Canada. The purpose of this introductory section of the 2009 revised CANMAT guidelines is to provide definitions of the depressive disorders (with an emphasis on MDD), summarize Canadian data concerning their epidemiology and describe overarching principles of managing these conditions. This section on ``Classification, Burden and Principles of Management'' is one of 5 guideline articles in the 2009 CANMAT guidelines. Methods The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question--answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to the Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. Results Epidemiologic data indicate that MDD afflicts 11% of Canadians at some time in their lives, and approximately 4% during any given year. MDD has a detrimental impact on overall health, role functioning and quality of life. Detection of MDD, accurate diagnosis and provision of evidence-based treatment are challenging tasks for both clinicians and for the health systems in which they work. Limitations Epidemiologic and clinical data cannot be seamlessly linked due to heterogeneity of syndromes within the population. Conclusions In the eight years since the last CANMAT Guidelines for Treatment of Depressive Disorders were published, progress has been made in understanding the epidemiology and treatment of these disorders.

Psychotherapy alone or in combination with antidepressant medication Background In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008--2009 to reflect advances in the field. This article, one of five in the series, reviews new studies of psychotherapy in the acute and maintenance phase of MDD, including computer-based and telephone-delivered psychotherapy. Methods The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question--answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. Evidence-based responses are based on updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations are graded according to the Level of Evidence, using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment are identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. Results Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) continue to have the most evidence for efficacy, both in acute and maintenance phases of MDD, and have been studied in combination with antidepressants. CBT is well studied in conjunction with computer-delivered methods and bibliotherapy. Behavioural Activation and Cognitive-Behavioural Analysis System of Psychotherapy have significant evidence, but need replication. Newer psychotherapies including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy do not yet have significant evidence as acute treatments; nor does psychodynamic therapy. Limitations Although many forms of psychotherapy have been studied, relatively few types have been evaluated for MDD in randomized controlled trials. Evidence about the combination of different types of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication is also limited despite widespread use of these therapies concomitantly. Conclusions CBT and IPT are the only first-line treatment recommendations for acute MDD and remain highly recommended for maintenance. Both computer-based and telephone-delivered psychotherapy---primarily studied with CBT and IPT---are useful second-line recommendations. Where feasible, combined antidepressant and CBT or IPT are recommended as first-line treatments for acute MDD.

Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. This section on ``Neurostimulation Therapies'' is one of 5 guidelines articles. Results Among the four forms of neurostimulation reviewed in this section, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has the most extensive evidence, spanning seven decades. Repetitive transcranial magnetic (rTMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have been approved to treat depressed adults in both Canada and the United States with a much smaller evidence base. There is also emerging evidence that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective for otherwise treatment resistant depression, but this is an investigational approach in 2009. Limitations Compared to other modalities for the treatment of MDD, the data based is limited by the relatively small numbers of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and small sample sizes. Conclusions There is most evidence to support ECT as a first-line treatment under specific circumstances and rTMS as a second-line treatment.

Study design This study included 6778 civilian noninstitutionalized participants in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions with nonpsychotic, non-substance-induced MDD. Subjects were divided into 3 groups on the basis of age at first episode of MDD: childhood-onset (CHLD; onset ≤12 yrs, n = 372), adolescent-onset (ADOL; onset 13 to 17 years, n = 854), and adult-onset (ADLT; onset ≥18 years, n = 5552). Results Compared with subjects with ADLT, CHLD MDD was associated with a greater number of MDD episodes, longer episode duration, increased suicidality, and increased need for hospitalization for MDD compared with adult-onset illness. Subjects with CHLD had a higher rate of psychiatric comorbidity and were more likely to have a parental history of MDD. Among subjects treated for MDD, latency from MDD onset to treatment was greater among subjects with CHLD compared with subjects with ADLT.

138,0,"Context-aware service engineering: A survey Context constitutes an essential part of service behaviour, especially when interaction with end-users is involved. As observed from the literature, context handling in service engineering has been during recent years a field of intense research, which has produced several interesting approaches. In this paper, we present research efforts that attempt mainly to decouple context handling from the service logic.

Beached, oil-contaminated sea birds, however, may be used as an indirect indicator. Reconstructing the drift of oil slicks and sea bird corpses in the southern North Sea for the period 1992--2003 by means of a two-dimensional numerical transport model driven by re-analysed weather data, we show with an example of two common sea bird species that the variability observed within the number of corpses registered during beached bird surveys for the German coast primarily reflects the inter-annual variability of prevailing weather conditions.

140,0,"Factors associated with pain interference in an epidemiologic sample of adults with bipolar I disorder Objective Epidemiologic studies have found that major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders are associated with pain. However, little is known regarding the prevalence and correlates of pain in bipolar I disorder (BD). Method The 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a nationally representative sample (N=43,093) of the US adult population, was used to determine if 1) prevalence of moderate-or-greater pain interference is elevated among subjects with 12-month history of BD, and 2) psychiatric and medical comorbidities independently contribute to increased pain interference in BD. Results Subjects with BD were significantly more likely to report pain interference of at least moderate severity compared to subjects without BD (24.8% versus 11.9%, p<0.001). Moderate or greater pain interference is also significantly more common among subjects with BD than those with MDD (20.3%) or anxiety disorders (19.3%; p<0.001). Logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounding variables indicated that BD is independently associated with increased pain interference (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.39--1.78). Factors associated with pain interference in BD included greater age, non-white race, lower income, increased frequency of arthritis and other medical problems, comorbid anxiety disorders, and comorbid substance use disorders. Conclusions The prevalence of pain interference is elevated in BD, even compared to MDD or anxiety disorders, and is associated with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

141,0,"Relationships of neuroticism and extraversion with axis I and II comorbidity among patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder Background High comorbidity with axis I and II disorders among major depressive disorder (MDD) patients may in part be due to the predisposing personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion. However, a comprehensive view of this relationship is lacking. Methods MDD patients (n=193) in the Vantaa Depression Study were interviewed at baseline and at 6 and 18 months with the SCAN and SCID-II, and a general population comparison group (n=388) surveyed by mail. Neuroticism and extraversion were measured with the Eysenck Personality Inventory. A dose--exposure relationship between standardized levels of neuroticism and extraversion and type and number of comorbid axis I and II disorders among patients with MDD was hypothesized. Results Prevalence and number of comorbid axis I and II disorders increased significantly with increasing level of neuroticism. In contrast, as the level of extraversion increased, the prevalences of social phobia and cluster C personality disorders decreased. Patients with pure MDD or with any comorbid axis I or II disorder had z-scores of neuroticism of +0.46, +0.90 and +1.30 and of extraversion of −0.34, −0.47 and −0.84, respectively. Limitations Patients' personality scores were not pre-morbid. Conclusion Among MDD patients, a positive dose--exposure relationship appears to exist between neuroticism and prevalence and number of comorbid axis I and II disorders. A negative relationship exists between level of extraversion and prevalence of social phobia and cluster C personality disorders. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that high neuroticism and low extraversion predispose to comorbid axis I and II disorders among patients with MDD.

Our objective was to evaluate the presence of PPS in a sample of SSRI non- or partial-responders with MDD and examine the effect of a switch to duloxetine on those PPS. Outpatients who met criteria for MDD despite having taken an SSRI antidepressant for at least 6 weeks, and who had a Hamilton depression rating scale total score of at least 15 and a clinical global impression of severity score of at least 3, were randomized to switch to duloxetine by either a direct switch or a start-taper switch method. PPS were assessed at baseline and at the study endpoint using various measures including six visual analog scales (VAS) for pain (overall pain, headache, back pain, shoulder pain, interference with daily activities, and time in pain while awake), the pain subscale of the symptom questionnaire-somatic subscale, and the bodily pain subscale of the short form-36 item health survey. Clinically significant levels of pain (mean baseline VAS scores >30mm) were seen across all VAS pain measures prior to switching. Switch to duloxetine was associated with significant improvements on all pain measures regardless of switch method, and there was evidence for an earlier reduction in pain in the start-taper switch group.

Methods Data were derived from NEMESIS, an epidemiologic survey in the adult population of the Netherlands. 400 Respondents who met the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) criteria of MDD and/or Dysth were selected. Cox proportional hazards analyses and Linear Mixed Models were conducted to examine 3-year course trajectories of MDD, Dysth and DD and determinants for course. Results Adjusted analyses showed similar course trajectories for Dysth and DD, which were significantly worse than the course for MDD. Determinants of unfavorable course were neuroticism and poor functioning. Limitations Attrition was higher among persons with Dysth.

A probabilistic model has been proposed to assist in the identification of BD among patients with depressive symptoms, however there are limited population-based data on the key distinguishers of BD from MDD. The objective of this study was to identify distinguishers of BD from MDD in a population-based sample. Methods Population-based data were extracted from the Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being. Sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, and depressive symptomatology were compared between subjects with BD (N=467) and MDD (N=4145). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant correlates of BD, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were determined for each model. Results BD and MDD subjects differed across a number of characteristics. Clinical variables significantly associated with BD included greater number of lifetime depressive episodes, earlier age of first depressive episode, lifetime anxiety disorder, problematic substance use, and lifetime suicide attempt. Symptoms significantly more common during a major depressive episode among BD subjects included agitation, suicidal ideation, anxious symptoms, and irritability. AUCs for these models ranged from 0.72 to 0.81. Limitations Data were not available for all potential distinguishers; subgroups of BD could not be determined; cross-sectional data.

Methods BD patients (n=191) from the Jorvi Bipolar Study, and MDD patients (n=358) from both the Vantaa Depression Study and the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study cohorts, were interviewed at baseline and at 18months. A general population comparison group (n=347) was surveyed by mail.

In logistic regression, the levels of neuroticism and extraversion did not differ between BD and MDD patients, or between BD I and II patients. Limitations Patients' personality scores were not pre-morbid. Conclusions Levels of neuroticism and extraversion are unlikely to differ between BD and MDD patients, or between BD I and II patients. The overall level of neuroticism is moderately higher and extraversion somewhat lower in BD patients than in the general population. High neuroticism may be an indicator of vulnerability to both bipolar and unipolar mood disorders.

149,0,"Evidence for the 2008 economic crisis exacerbating depression in Hong Kong Background There is a lack of population-level research on the relationship between economic contraction and specific mental disorders and how individual-level variables may mediate such a relationship. Methods Two cross-sectional surveys using identical random sampling and diagnostic methods were conducted among Hong Kong adults in 2007 (January--February) and 2009 (April--May). 3016 and 2011 Chinese speaking adults completed structured interviews based on the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) (DSM-IV). Results The twelve-month prevalence of DSM-IV major depressive episode (MDE) was significantly higher in 2009 (12.5%) than 2007 (8.5%). A significant increase of prevalence was found in both male and female respondents, those in the highest (55--65years) age group, having secondary education level, were married/cohabited, divorced/widowed, employed, home-making, and in the lowest and high-middle income groups. Those with large investment loss had a significantly higher prevalence of MDE (20.3%) than those with less or no-investment loss (9.2--13.7%). The symptom pattern and severity of depression in 2007 and 2009 were similar. Conclusion Economic contraction triggered by a global financial crisis was associated with a significant increase in the risk of depression in the Hong Kong population. This increase was not explained primarily by unemployment and had a significant contribution from employed, home-making, high-middle income, and having married people. A holistic perspective that encompasses both ecological and individual levels of analysis is essential for studying the net impact of economic contraction on depression across communities and sociodemographic groups and for health policy planning.

150,0,"Impairment in psychosocial functioning associated with dysthymic disorder in the NESARC study Background Chronic depression is associated with impaired functioning. The National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC) is a representative sample (N=43,093) of the United States non-institutionalized population aged 18years and older. We hypothesized that individuals with chronic low-grade depression, dysthymic disorder, would have more impaired functioning than individuals with acute major depression or the general population. Method Diagnoses were generated by the NIAAA Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV Version (AUDADIS-IV). The dysthymic disorder (DD) sample (N=328) consisted of DD diagnosis without current MDD. The dysthymic group was not chosen on the basis of alcohol use or abuse. Individuals with MDD with duration ≦24months, without lifetime DD constituted the acute depression (AD) sample (N=712). All other respondents were classified as general population (GP) (N=42,052). Past year functioning was assessed by Supplemental Social Security Income (SSI), employment, and Medicaid statuses. Past month functioning was assessed by Short-form 12-Item Health Survey (SF-12), with scores for social functioning, role emotional functioning, and mental health, using odds ratios. Results Over the past year, compared to AD, persons with DD were less likely to work full-time (36.2% vs. 44%; OR=0.70, CI=.54,.92) and more often received SSI (13.9% vs. 4.5%; OR=3.4, CI=2.0,5.9) and Medicaid (20.2% vs. 13%; OR=1.7 , CI=1.1,2.6). Dysthymics reported accomplishing less over the past month due to emotional problems, and that emotional or physical problems interfered with social activities. Relative to GP, respondents with DD were more likely to receive SSI (13.9% vs. 2.9%; OR=4.6, CI 3.4,6.2) and Medicaid (20.2% vs. 5.9%; OR=2.9, CI 2.0,4.1).

151,0,"Pathways linking socioeconomic status to obesity through depression and lifestyle factors among young US adults Obesity and depression are two diseases of major public health importance. While both correlate with each other, potential pathways involving depression that would link socioeconomic status (SES) to lifestyle factors and obesity have not been systematically examined using nationally representative data. Using rich data on 2217 US young adults aged 20--39years from the 1999--2004 National Health and Nutrition Surveys (NHANES) and multivariate linear and logistic regression models, we examined associations between major depressive disorder (MDD), dietary intake, physical activity (PA), and measured body mass index (BMI) controlling for socio-demographic factors. Further, structural equation models (SEM) were fit to test pathway explaining SES disparities in BMI through MDD and lifestyle factors. Recent prevalence of MDD was lower among young US men than women (6.4% vs. 9.2%) although their prevalence of obesity was similar (21.2% vs. 22.7%). Among women, MDD was associated with higher BMI and inversely associated with PA, but not among men. MDD was specifically associated with increased risk of morbid obesity (BMI≥40) among women (OR: 2.88 (1.32, 6.30)). Using SEM, a main pathway linking SES to BMI among women was linking SES→food insecurity→MDD→PA→BMI. A main pathway linking MDD to BMI in both genders was going through PA rather than overall dietary quality. Gender and ethnic differences existed underlying how MDD, SES and lifestyle factors were associated with adiposity. Future prospective studies are needed to examine potential mechanisms using physiological markers of depression, lifestyle and obesity.

152,0,"Quantifying point prevalence of major depressive episode using lifetime structured diagnostic interviews Background Estimates of the prevalence of mental disorders are vital for policy and practice. The aim of the current study was to compare estimates of point (30-day) prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) derived from a lifetime diagnostic interview with estimates derived from an interview exclusively focussing on the 30 days prior to interview. Methods Study design consisted of face-to-face survey interviews using two separate versions (lifetime and current) of the depression module of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). The setting was an outpatient tertiary referral centre for the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders. One hundred and sixty four people were randomly allocated to receive either the lifetime or current version of the WMH-CIDI. Point prevalent cases derived from the lifetime interview were compared to point prevalent cases comprehensively assessed by the current interview. Results The risk of being diagnosed with current MDE having been interviewed with a lifetime interview was higher, but not significantly higher, than the risk of being diagnosed with current MDE having been interviewed with a current interview (RR=1.29, 95% CI: 0.82--2.03). Derived and comprehensive point prevalent cases were similar with regard to a range of depression-related clinical characteristics. Limitations The size of the sample precluded the ability to determine the equivalence of prevalence estimates. The observed relationships may be different in general community samples. Conclusions Point prevalence of MDE derived from a lifetime diagnostic interview may be slightly higher than that derived from a comprehensive current interview. However, point prevalent cases, regardless of how they are derived, are similar with regard to depression-related clinical characteristics.

The present study evaluated the association between cognitive dysfunction and major depressive disorder (MDD, N=70) as compared with age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n=206) and its relationship to general functioning (physical and mental health quality of life, activities of daily living, and employment status) in participants with current MDD (n=26) and those with previous MDD only (n=44). Participants were assessed clinically using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for the depression groups and the Diagnostic Interview for Psychoses (DIP-DM) for the control group. Measures to evaluate cognition and quality of lifes comprised the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the Short Form-36 Health Survey Questionnaire, and the Activities/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL/IADL); employment status was also assessed in MDD. The results showed that a) while individuals with current depression had worse cognitive performance in all domains than healthy controls, those individuals with previous depression had lasting cognitive impairments in the domains of immediate memory and attention as compared with healthy controls; b) individuals with current depression had lower scores in the visuospatial/constructional and attention domains and the total score than individuals with previous depression; c) individuals in the depression group as a whole who were currently unemployed had significantly lower scores in all domains (except attention) of cognitive function; d) cognitive function was not related to either physical or mental quality of life or impairments of activities of daily living (ADL, IADL); e) that unemployment in previous depression was related to poor cognitive function similar to those with current depression.

156,0,"Trajectories of recovery of social and physical functioning in major depression, dysthymic disorder and double depression: A 3-year follow-up Background Depressive disorders have a large impact on psychosocial functioning. Since lower functioning predicts recurrence of a depressive episode, insight into the post-morbid course of psychosocial functioning of persons with different depressive disorders may facilitate recurrence prevention. Methods Data were derived from NEMESIS, an epidemiologic survey in the adult population in the Netherlands. Respondents, who met the CIDI criteria of major depression (MDD; n=102), dysthymic disorder (Dysth; n=66) or double depression (DD; n=73) at baseline, and recovered during three year follow-up, were included; as was a control group without any diagnosis (NoDiag, n=4140). Functioning was assessed using the Groningen Social Disability Schedule (GSDS) and the SF-36 physical health summary-scale. Linear Mixed Models were conducted to compare 3-year trajectories of functioning across depressive groups and with NoDiag group. Results Compared to NoDiag, all depressed groups were significantly impaired on social and physical functioning. Dysth and DD had a lower level of post-morbid physical functioning compared to MDD (after 1 and 3years respectively: Dysth: B=−13.8, p=.002 and B=−8.11, p=.09; DD: B=−8.9, p=.03 and B=−9.1, p=.05). Determinants for impaired social functioning (neuroticism) and for impaired physical functioning (age, comorbid somatic disorders and neuroticism) were identified. Limitations Attrition was higher among persons with a depression. Inclusion of the drop-outs would most likely have resulted in stronger associations, since we expect lower functioning among the drop-outs. Conclusion This study indicates the long-term debilitating effects of psychopathology, even after recovery of depressive disorders.

By executing model transformations the environment allows developers to generate executable code for specific platforms. The tools presented in this work help developers to model home automation systems by means of a domain specific language which is later transformed into code for home automation specific platforms. These transformations have been defined by means of graph grammars and template engines extended with traceability capabilities. Our framework also allows the models to be reused for different applications since a catalogue of requirements is provided. This framework enables the development of home automation applications with techniques for improving the quality of both the process and the models obtained.

158,0,"Antidepressant Utilization, Adherence, and Health Care Spending in the United States: The Case of MDD Patients 2000-2007 Objective Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been widely adopted in the US as the first-line treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). This study attempted to understand how patient factors and antidepressant choice influenced medication adherence and associated health care expenditures. Study Design A retrospective multiple-year cross-sectional study was conducted. This study used the 2004-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey database; MDD patients who filled one or more prescriptions of antidepressants were extracted. Data were analyzed using weighted ordinary least squares regressions to examine MDD patient antidepressant adherence (measured by proportional days covered) and impacts of patient factors on associated health care expenditures. Results Sociological factors such as patient ethnicity and health insurance status were associated with differential levels of antidepressant adherence and associated health expenditures. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with the lowest antidepressant adherence among all. Patients covered by insurance were associated with better proportional days covered and spent more on MDD-specific drugs compared with uninsured patients. Use of newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors was associated with an increase in MDD-specific drug expenditure. Conclusions Differences in antidepressant adherence and health care spending across patient factors could have important policy implications for health disparity; certain patient populations may be at higher risk for inadequate health care.

159,0,"Assessing pain in depression: what do ratings on unidimensional pain scales really mean? Objective The study aims to determine which dimensions of pain---somatosensory, affective, or evaluative---would predict unidimensional pain scores in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); compare the results with findings in cancer and chronic musculoskeletal pain patients; and examine the relationship between pain complaints and psychopathology. Methods This is a 3-month prospective, observational study. Ninety-one Chinese patients were enrolled during an acute episode of MDD. Multidimensional Affect and Pain Survey (MAPS) was used to assess the multidimensional aspects of pain. Unidimensional pain intensity was evaluated using verbal rating scale (VRS) and visual analog scale (VAS). Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results The VRS and VAS pain scores were more highly correlated with MAPS somatosensory supercluster than with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and MAPS emotional and well-being superclusters. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that unidimensional pain scores were predicted better by MAPS somatosensory than by emotional clusters. The explained variance of VRS and VAS scores could be improved by 9% to 16% by adding somatosensory clusters after controlling for emotional clusters, whereas 1% to 4% of the variance was improved by adding emotional clusters after controlling for somatosensory clusters. Pain intensity was more closely related to anxiety symptoms than to depressive symptoms cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Conclusion Our data suggest that pain and emotional symptoms in MDD are not entirely related. In cases in which pain symptoms are severe or remain persistent despite treatment of depression, specific strategy targeting pain may be needed.

Little is known of the psychiatric and substance use disorder characteristics of this population, or their impact on everyday function, employment, and life quality. Methods HIV-infected (HIV+) former plasma donors (N=203) and HIV-negative (HIV−) donor controls (N=198) completed the World Mental Health Survey Composite International Diagnostic Interview to determine lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), substance use disorders, and suicidality. Current mood and suicidality were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Everyday function was measured by an Activity of Daily Living questionnaire; life quality was evaluated by the Medical Outcomes Study --- HIV. Results HIV+ participants had known their infected status for 2years on average. Most were taking antiretroviral treatment and had frank AIDS. Rates of current MDD were similar across groups (1--2%), but HIV+ had a higher frequency of lifetime MDD (14% vs. 5%, p<.05). Its onset preceded date of known infection in one-third of cases. Alcoholism was the only substance use disorder detected; HIV+ had a higher proportion of lifetime substance use diagnoses (14% vs. 6%, p<.05). Depression and AIDS independently predicted worse daily functioning and life quality, and unemployment.

161,0,"Racial Differences in Symptoms, Comorbidity, and Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder Among Black and White Adults Objective : Racial differences in the clinical nature of major depressive disorder (MDD) could contribute to treatment disparities, but national data with large samples are limited. Our objective was to examine black-white differences in clinical characteristics and treatment for MDD from one of the largest, national community samples of US adults. Methods : Non-Hispanic black and white adults (n = 32752) from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions produced data on 1866 respondents who met criteria for MDD based on the Diagnosfic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) in the preceding 12 months. Outcome measures were depressive symptoms, comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders, disability, and treatment. Results : Blacks with MDD had significantly higher odds of initial insomnia, early-morning awakening, and restlessness than whites. Odds of hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-3.14), obesity (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.45-2.69), and liver disease (OR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.20-11.30) were higher among blacks than whites. In unadjusted models, blacks had greater impairment than whites in social and physical functioning. However, adjusting for sociode-mographic characteristics eliminated these differences. Blacks were less likely than whites to receive outpatient services (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.72) and be prescribed medications for MDD, but were more likely to receive emergency room and inpatient treatment. Conclusions : We found few racial differences in depressive symptoms, psychiatric comorbidity, and disability after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Blacks' lower utilization of ambulatory treatment for MDD and greater medical comorbidity, emergency department use, and hospitalization suggests that management of MDD among blacks should be emphasized in primary care or other settings where treatment is more accessible.

Data were used from the 766 trauma-exposed subjects in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (conducted in the early 2000s) with PTSD and MDD symptom ratings. Results demonstrate that MDD symptoms were less frequently endorsed than PTSD symptoms---even for the three symptoms shared between the disorders. PTSD and MDD items represented a single, underlying dimension, although modest support was found for a secondary sub-factor. Removing their shared symptoms, and additional depression-related dysphoria symptoms, continued to result in a single underlying PTSD-MDD symptom dimension.

We investigate the prevalence of depression in cancer and review the current state of evidence regarding the effectiveness of drug treatment of depression in this group. Methods We conducted a literature search for reports of prevalence rate of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in cancer patients based on Structured Clinical Interview based on DSM (SCID). We estimated the prevalence rate by combining the data of all reports. In addition we identified controlled trials studying the effect of psychotropic drugs in depressed cancer patients. Results Based on the 31 reports, the estimated prevalence rate of depression in cancer patients is 10.8% (996/9248). There were 8 trials comparing antidepressant with other active treatment in cancer patients. Only mianserin and alprazolam demonstrated to improve the depressive symptoms. Limitations This literature review cannot resolve the challenge of diagnosing depression in severely ill and is subject to publication bias. Conclusion Despite the high prevalence of depression in cancer patients, studies on effective pharmacotherapy are relatively scarce. The evidence for the efficacy of conventional medication used for the treatment of depression such as tricyclics antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is very limited. It is possible that they may be less suitable in this setting because of their relatively late onset of action.

Method A survey was mailed to participants in the MATR in 1999. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds ratios to assess associations between CFS-like illness and each comorbid condition. Results A total of 4590 completed surveys were collected. Most participants were female (86.3%); mean age was 44.7 years. Among participants with a CFS-like illness, lifetime prevalences of CWP, IBS, and MDD were 41%, 16%, and 57% respectively. Participants reporting at least one of the three comorbid conditions were about 14 times more likely to have CFS-like illness than those without CWP, IBS, or MDD (95% confidence interval 8.1%--21.3%). Only MDD showed a temporal pattern of presentation during the same year as diagnosis of CFS-like illness.

167,0,"Managing moose harvests by the seat of your pants Moose populations are managed for sustainable yield balanced against costs caused by damage to forestry or agriculture and collisions with vehicles. Optimal harvests can be calculated based on a structured population model driven by data on abundance and the composition of bulls, cows, and calves obtained by aerial-survey monitoring during winter. Quotas are established by the respective government agency and licenses are issued to hunters to harvest an animal of specified age or sex during the following autumn. Because the cost of aerial monitoring is high, we use a Management Strategy Evaluation to evaluate the costs and benefits of periodic aerial surveys in the context of moose management. Our on-the-fly ``seat of your pants'' alternative to independent monitoring is management based solely on the kill of moose by hunters, which is usually sufficient to alert the manager to declines in moose abundance that warrant adjustments to harvest strategies. Harvests are relatively cheap to monitor; therefore, data can be obtained each year facilitating annual adjustments to quotas.

168,0,"Mitochondria, oligodendrocytes and inflammation in bipolar disorder: Evidence from transcriptome studies points to intriguing parallels with multiple sclerosis Gene expression studies of bipolar disorder (BPD) have shown changes in transcriptome profiles in multiple brain regions. Here we summarize the most consistent findings in the scientific literature, and compare them to data from schizophrenia (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The transcriptome profiles of all three disorders overlap, making the existence of a BPD-specific profile unlikely. Three groups of functionally related genes are consistently expressed at altered levels in BPD, SZ and MDD. Genes involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function are downregulated, genes involved in immune response and inflammation are upregulated, and genes expressed in oligodendrocytes are downregulated. Experimental paradigms for multiple sclerosis demonstrate a tight link between energy metabolism, inflammation and demyelination. These studies also show variabilities in the extent of oligodendrocyte stress, which can vary from a downregulation of oligodendrocyte genes, such as observed in psychiatric disorders, to cell death and brain lesions seen in multiple sclerosis. We conclude that experimental models of multiple sclerosis could be of interest for the research of BPD, SZ and MDD.

169,0,"Quality of life in major depressive disorder: the role of pain and pain catastrophizing cognition Objective Pain symptoms are frequent complaints in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Although it is known that pain intensity and pain-related cognition predict quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic pain, limited studies have examined their roles in MDD. The study aimed to determine whether pain and pain catastrophizing were independent predictors of QOL in MDD after accounting for the impact of anxiety and depression. Methods This is a prospective, naturalistic follow-up study. Ninety-one Chinese patients were enrolled during an acute episode of MDD, 82 of them were reassessed 3 months later using the same assessment on pain, anxiety, depression, and QOL. Pain intensity was evaluated using a verbal rating scale and a visual analog scale. Quality of life was assessed using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. Pain-related cognition was assessed at baseline with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Results There was significant improvement in pain, anxiety, depression, and QOL from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that pain intensity was significantly associated with QOL at baseline and 3 months. Pain complaint was more important than anxiety and depressive symptoms in predicting changes in both physical and psychosocial domains of QOL. After controlling for the severity of pain, anxiety, and depression, Pain Catastrophizing Scale score was independently associated with QOL in MDD. Conclusion The study supports the specific role of pain and pain-related cognition in predicting QOL in depressed patients. Further studies targeting pain-related cognition for improving the outcome of MDD are necessary.

Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of bipolar disorders by means of a screening instrument in seven communities within six regions of Italy and evaluate the appropriateness and number of prescriptions for ADs in bipolar depression. Methods Study design: community survey. Study population: samples randomly drawn, after stratification from the adult population of municipal records. Sample size: 4999 people from seven communities within six regions of Italy. Tools: questionnaire on psychotropic drug consumption, prescription, health services utilization; Structured Clinical Interview NP for DSM-IV modified (ANTAS); Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ). Training: interviewers were trained psychologists or medical doctors. Study limitations: the population studied did not represent a nationally representative multistage clustered area probability sample of households. Results 3398 subjects were interviewed (68% of recruited sample). Positivity at MDQ (MDQ+) was higher in males (3.4% vs. 2.8%) but the difference was not significant (OR=1.2, P=0.37). The association between MDQ+ and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) was statistically significant for both males (OR=14.9, P<0.0001) and females (OR=8.3, P<0.001); 30% of subjects with MDQ+ and MDD lifetime diagnosis were taking ADs.

Methods This was a household survey of 6616 adult residents of Singapore which constituted a national representative sample. Face to face interviews were conducted with the English, Chinese and Malay versions of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The response rate was 75.9%. Results The lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for MDD were 5.8% and 2.2%, respectively. MDD was significantly higher among the females, Indians, those who were divorced/separated, or widowed. The median age of onset of MDD was 26 years with the highest risk of onset in those aged 18--34 years while the age group of 65 years and above had the lowest risk of onset. Chronic physical conditions were present in approximately half of the respondents with MDD. MDD was also associated with considerable disability in terms of days of role impairment. More than half (59.6%) of those with lifetime MDD had not ever sought professional help. Limitations This was a cross-sectional household survey that excluded those who were institutionalized.

Methods The analyzed sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007--2010 included 536 adults who indicated that they were current or former smokers, had at least mild pulmonary impairment (FEV1/FVC<0.70), and provided depression and physical activity data. Results After controlling for asthma status, pulmonary impairment, age, poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), education, gender, marital status, body mass index (BMI), cotinine, comorbidity index, race-ethnicity, and smoking status, those who met physical activity guidelines had a 59% (odds ratio (OR)=0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18--0.94) lower odds of having MDD. Using multivariate linear regression with depression symptoms as the outcome variable, and after adjustments, physical activity was inversely associated with depression symptoms in a dose--response manner; lowest tertile was the referent group, middle tertile coefficient: −1.06 (95% CI: −1.98 to −0.14), and highest tertile coefficient: −1.10 (95% CI: −1.84 to −0.34).

174,0,"Empathy in adults with clinical or subclinical depressive symptoms Background Depression is associated with problems in social functioning. Impaired empathic abilities might underlie this association. Empathy is a multidimensional construct and involves both affective and cognitive processes. We reviewed the literature to find out to what extent depression may be associated with abnormal levels of affective and cognitive empathy. We also explored potential gender differences in these associations. Methods We used PsycInfo and Medline to conduct a systematic review of all studies on empathy and depression conducted in individuals with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD; patient samples) or in individuals with primarily subclinical depressive symptoms (analog samples). Results Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated that depression was related to one type of affective empathy. Specifically, depression was related to high levels of empathic stress but not to abnormal empathic concern. Further, depression was related to limited cognitive empathy, as indicated by poor perspective taking, theory of mind, and empathic accuracy. Limitations Few studies have considered the variable gender in their design and analyses. Between and within study variation in demographic and clinical variables limits the interpretation of results. Self-report measures of empathy are subjective and vulnerable to bias. Poor performance on the more objective laboratory tasks might partially be explained by the broader cognitive deficits commonly observed in depression. Lastly, because all studies used a cross-sectional design, causality is difficult to establish. Conclusions Empathic abilities may be impaired in depression. The relation between empathy, depression, and gender is unclear. Future studies could use implicit and more ecologically valid measures of empathy.

175,0,"Equality in cumulative voting: A systematic review with an improvement proposal Context Prioritization is an essential part of requirements engineering, software release planning and many other software engineering disciplines. Cumulative Voting (CV) is known as a relatively simple method for prioritizing requirements on a ratio scale. Historically, CV has been applied in decision-making in government elections, corporate governance, and forestry. However, CV prioritization results are of a special type of data---compositional data. Objectives The purpose of this study is to aid decision-making by collecting knowledge on the empirical use of CV and develop a method for detecting prioritization items with equal priority. Methods We present a systematic literature review of CV and CV analysis methods. The review is based on searching electronic databases and snowball sampling of the found primary studies. Relevant studies are selected based on titles, abstracts, and full text inspection. Additionally, we propose Equality of Cumulative Votes (ECVs)---a CV result analysis method that identifies prioritization items with equal priority. Results CV has been used in not only requirements prioritization and release planning but also in e.g. software process improvement, change impact analysis and model driven software development. The review presents a collection of state of the practice studies and CV result analysis methods. In the end, ECV was applied to 27 prioritization cases from 14 studies and identified nine groups of equal items in three studies. Conclusions We believe that the analysis of the collected studies and the CV result analysis methods can help in the adoption of CV prioritization method.

Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) wave 1 (n=43,093) and wave 2 (n=34,653) were utilized to determine transitional rates, and predictors of category transitions, over a 3-year period. Analyses revealed very high 3-year remission rates for PD and PDA (75% and 67%, respectively), although relapse also was relatively frequent (PD=12%; PDA=21%). Logistic regression revealed previous history of panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder/major depression (GAD/MDD), nicotine dependence, female sex, younger age, and major financial crises to be reliable predictors of incidence and relapse. The direction and magnitude of association of many predictor variables were similar for PD and PDA, with notable exceptions for social anxiety and romantic relationship factors. Clinicians should be aware of the relapsing--remitting nature of PD and PDA and, thus, take caution to not reduce or eliminate effective treatments prematurely. Similarly, the current study suggests clinicians pay particular attention to concurrent factors relevant to relapse in PD/PDA that may also be clinically addressed (e.g., co-morbid MDD/GAD and nicotine dependence).

The risk factors of these disorders are not completely well known. Developing knowledge on occupational risk factors for mental disorders appears crucial. This study investigates the association between various classical and emergent psychosocial work factors and major depressive and generalised anxiety disorders in the French working population. Methods The study was based on a national random sample of 3765 men and 3944 women of the French working population (SIP 2006 survey). Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) were measured using a standardised diagnostic interview (MINI). Occupational factors included psychosocial work factors as well as biomechanical, physical, and chemical exposures. Adjustment variables included age, occupation, marital status, social support, and life events. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis. Results Low decision latitude, overcommitment, and emotional demands were found to be risk factors for both MDD--GAD among both genders. Other risk factors were observed: high psychological demands, low reward, ethical conflict, and job insecurity, but differences were found according to gender and outcome. Significant interaction terms were observed suggesting that low decision latitude, high psychological demands, and job insecurity had stronger effects on mental disorders for men than for women. Limitations Given the cross-sectional study design, no causal conclusion could be drawn. Conclusions This study showed significant associations between classical and emergent psychosocial work factors and MDD--GAD.

However, little effort has been devoted at collecting evidence to evaluate their actual relevance, benefits and usage complications. Goal The main goals of this paper are: (1) assess the diffusion and relevance of software modelling and MD techniques in the Italian industry, (2) understand the expected and achieved benefits, and (3) identify which problems limit/prevent their diffusion. Method We conducted an exploratory personal opinion survey with a sample of 155 Italian software professionals by means of a Web-based questionnaire on-line from February to April 2011. Results Software modelling and MD techniques are very relevant in the Italian industry. The adoption of simple modelling brings common benefits (better design support, documentation improvement, better maintenance, and higher software quality), while MD techniques make it easier to achieve: improved standardization, higher productivity, and platform independence. We identified problems, some hindering adoption (too much effort required and limited usefulness) others preventing it (lack of competencies and supporting tools). Conclusions The relevance represents an important objective motivation for researchers in this area. The relationship between techniques and attainable benefits represents an instrument for practitioners planning the adoption of such techniques. In addition the findings may provide hints for companies and universities.

A previously proposed four-step approach assesses the stage of development for a biological finding into a clinically useful diagnostic test. Using this approach, we evaluated the progress of the DEX/CRH test using meta-analysis as a part of step 1. A literature review identified 15 studies of the DEX/CRH test in patients with MDD and healthy controls. Meta-analysis estimated the effect size, heterogeneity, and confidence intervals using random effects models. Studies consistent with any step of the four-step approach were identified, and their characteristics were presented. Eleven studies reported significantly higher cortisol levels with the DEX/CRH test in patients with MDD, compared with the healthy controls (step 1). Eight eligible studies were included in meta-analysis, and had an effect size of 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.70--1.97). Most studies were step-1 studies (comparison of patients and healthy controls), and no step-4 studies (multicenter trials) were found.

Immunological differences have been reported in both major affective disorders and suicidal behavior. Specifically, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to correlate with the severity of depression and various cytokines have been identified as potentially important in understanding the pathophysiology of major affective disorders/suicidality. We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the current literature to investigate the association between inflammatory cytokines and suicidal behavior. Only articles from peer-reviewed journals were selected for inclusion in the present review. Most studies documented the association between suicidality and IL2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and VEGF levels that have been found altered in suicidal behavior. The presence of major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal ideation/attempts was associated with differences in inflammatory cytokine profile when compared to that without suicidal ideation/attempts. Most suicide attempters or subjects with suicidal ideation showed an imbalance of the immune system but this does not imply the existence of a causal link. Also, not all studies demonstrated a positive correlation between inflammatory cytokines and suicidal behavior.

185,0,"Transforming and tracing reused requirements models to home automation models Context Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) has emerged as a very promising approach to cope with the inherent complexity of modern software-based systems. Furthermore, it is well known that the Requirements Engineering (RE) stage is critical for a project's success. Despite the importance of RE, MDSD approaches commonly leave textual requirements specifications to one side. Objective Our aim is to integrate textual requirements specifications into the MDSD approach by using the MDSD techniques themselves, including metamodelling and model transformations. The proposal is based on the assumption that a reuse-based Model-Driven Requirements Engineering (MDRE) approach will improve the requirements engineering stage, the quality of the development models generated from requirements models, and will enable the traces from requirements to other development concepts (such as analysis or design) to be maintained. Method The approach revolves around the Requirements Engineering Metamodel, denominated as REMM, which supports the definition of the boilerplate based textual requirements specification languages needed for the definition of model transformation from application requirements models to platform-specific application models and code. Results The approach has been evaluated through its application to Home Automation (HA) systems. The HA Requirement Specification Language denominated as HAREL is used to define application requirements models which will be automatically transformed and traced to the application model conforming to the HA Domain Specific Language. Conclusions An anonymous online survey has been conducted to evaluate the degree of acceptance by both HA application developers and MDSD practitioners. The main conclusion is that 66.7% of the HA experts polled strongly agree that the automatic transformation of the requirements models to HA models improves the quality of the HA models. Moreover, 58.3% of the HA participants strongly agree with the usefulness of the traceability matrix which links requirements to HA functional units in order to discover which devices are related to a specific requirement.

189,0,"Age-related differences in the influence of major mental disorders on suicidality: A Korean nationwide community sample Background We compared the influence of major mental disorders on suicidality according to age, adjusting for suicide-related correlates. Methods This study was based on the Korean national epidemiological survey of mental disorders including community-dwelling adults between 18 and 74 years of age (n=6022). Subjects were classified into three age groups; young (18--39), middle-aged (40--59), and late adulthood (60--74). Face-to-face interviews were conducted using the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. According to age groups, the influence of major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder on risk for suicidality were investigated by multiple logistic regression models adjusting for sex, years of education, marital status, income, employment, presence of chronic medical illness, and lifetime history of suicide attempt. Results After including MDD as a covariate, anxiety disorder remained a risk factor only in the middle-aged group (adjusted OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.54--5.22), and alcohol use disorder was a risk factor for suicidality only in the young group (adjusted OR: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.06--7.43). Conversely, MDD was the only mental disorder that significantly increased suicidality in all age groups. Limitations This was a cross-sectional study and did not include subjects over 75 years of age. Conclusion This study showed that the contribution of psychiatric disorders to risk for suicidality varied according to age group. Therefore, strategies for suicide prevention should be specifically designed for different age groups.

190,0,"Cognitive dysfunction in unipolar depression: Implications for treatment Objective The primary objective of this review is to examine the literature assessing abnormalities in neural circuitry and cognition early in the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the impact of these features on treatment selection and long-term outcomes. Data Sources English language and peer-reviewed publications were obtained by PubMed/Medline (www.pubmed.org) searches using combinations of major depressive disorder, major depression, or unipolar depression and ``first episode'', early, cognition, cognitive, executive function and memory. The terms bipolar and psychosis were excluded from the searches. These searches yielded 409 records. Study selection A total of 12 studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were selected that evaluated learning, memory and executive function in individuals with major depressive disorder. Additional publications meeting these criteria were identified from the bibliographies of the 12 selected articles and from the ``related citations'' section of PubMed. Results Difficulty in concentrating and indecisiveness are reported as among the most troubling symptoms by patients with MDD and may limit functional recovery. Cognitive deficits in memory and decision-making are present early in the course of MDD and may be accompanied by structural abnormalities in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex involved in cognitive functions. Although resolution of cognitive symptoms of depression lags behind recovery from mood symptoms in many patients, preliminary evidence suggests they may improve with antidepressant therapy, but can also persist residually. Conclusions New strategies that target cognitive symptoms of depression in addition to mood symptoms are needed to improve long-term outcomes, particularly functional recovery.

The present study explored psychosocial risk (Negative Interaction) and protective factors (Family Cohesion, Social Support, Religious Involvement, Racial and Ethnic Identity) for major depressive disorder (MDD), general anxiety disorder (GAD), and suicidal ideation (SI) among Latinas participating in the first national mental health epidemiological survey of Latina Americans. Method We conducted three sets of logistic regressions, predicting outcomes for 1,427 Latinas identified in the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), the first nationally representative, epidemiological study of Latino and Asian Americans living in the United States. These analyses followed preplanned steps: Model 1 used known predictors as controls and Model 2 added psychosocial risk and predictive factors beyond the known predictors. Results For each outcome examined, psychosocial risk and protective factors produced a significantly better model fit in Model 2 than sociodemographic and acculturation variables known to predict mental health outcomes in Model 1. Negative Interactions were associated with increased likelihood of GAD and SI, whereas Family Cohesion seemed to be protective against GAD. No psychosocial factors predicted MDD. Conclusions Differential protective and risk factors for major psychiatric disorders suggest that assessment and intervention may need certain sex-specific components in order to improve health care and prevention for Latinas.

Methods In 2007 and 2011, surveys were conducted among gay men in Geneva, Switzerland, recruited by probability-based time-space sampling. Based on a case vignette of a man with major depression, respondents were asked a series of questions about labelling, perceived risk, and help-seeking beliefs. Men meeting caseness for major depression were asked open questions about perceived causes and additional help-seeking/self-help. Results Among the 762 respondents, 14.7% met diagnostic criteria for major depression (MDD) in the past 12 months. The vignette was labelled depression by 44.1% of the entire sample, and 61.9% of the men with MDD. Discrimination (33.2%), acceptance or rejection by others (21.4%), and loneliness (24.9%) were the most common reasons given for greater susceptibility among gay men, yet men with MDD reported problems with love/relationship (32.5%) and work (28.9%) as the most common perceived causes of recent depression, and problems with love/relationship (21.9%), accepting one's homosexuality (21.1%), and family (20.2%) at initial outset. The highest proportions of gay men rated non-medical options such as a close friend (91.6%), relaxation exercises or meditation (84.4%), and physical activity (83.5%) as being helpful for the depression vignette. Limitations No probes used for open questions, and findings generalizable only to gay men in the sampling scheme.

Method Suicidal ideation, plans and attempts were assessed in face-to-face interviews of respondents selected by a multistage probability sampling using items on suicidality from the WHO SUPRE-MISS questionnaire. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to generate DSM-IV diagnoses of GAD and MDD. A total of 19309 subjects were studied. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted controlling for demographic characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity. Results The prevalence estimates for suicide ideation, plans and attempts were 1.7% (95% CI: 1.4--1.9), 0.9% (CI: 0.7--1.1) and 0.5% (CI: 0.4--0.7) respectively. Younger people (16--24years) had higher risk of suicidal behavior (OR: 2.6, CI: 1.08--6.2). Females (OR: 1.6, CI: 1.2--2.1) and Indians (OR: 3.3, CI: 2.2--4.9) also had higher risk. Conclusion The prevalence of suicidal behavior in Malaysia is low, but it broadly corresponds to the pattern described in other countries.

Despite this, it remains unknown how cognitive function is measured in routine clinical practice. The objective of this study was to assess psychiatrists' awareness of cognitive dysfunction in mental health disorders and their methods of cognitive assessment. An online survey was disseminated to psychiatrists in Europe, Asia, Australia and the United States. The survey asked about their perceptions of cognitive dysfunction in several mental health disorders, knowledge of cognitive assessment, method of cognitive assessment, and instruments used to measure cognitive function. Among the 61 respondents, most perceived that schizophrenia was associated with the greatest cognitive dysfunction. Many were unaware whether guidelines were available on cognitive assessment. In schizophrenia, 59% of psychiatrists reportedly used cognitive instruments, while the remainder relied solely on patient history interviews. The use of instruments to assess cognition in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) was lower, 38% and 37% respectively. Of the reported instruments used, only a few were actually appropriate for use in the diseases of interest (12% in schizophrenia, 3% in MDD and 0% in BPD). Other instruments reported were clinical measures that did not assess cognition. These findings reveal some inconsistencies in psychiatrists' routine clinical evaluation of cognitive function.

196,0,"A diagnostic meta-analysis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) algorithm scoring method as a screen for depression Background The depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used depression screening instrument in nonpsychiatric settings. The PHQ-9 can be scored using different methods, including an algorithm based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and a cut-off based on summed-item scores. The algorithm was the originally proposed scoring method to screen for depression. We summarized the diagnostic test accuracy of the PHQ-9 using the algorithm scoring method across a range of validation studies and compared the diagnostic properties of the PHQ-9 using the algorithm and summed scoring method at the proposed cut-off point of 10. Methods We performed a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies of the PHQ-9 using the algorithm scoring method to detect major depressive disorder (MDD). We used meta-analytic methods to calculate summary sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios for diagnosing MDD of the PHQ-9 using algorithm scoring method. In studies that reported both scoring methods (algorithm and summed-item scoring at proposed cut-off point of ≥10), we compared the diagnostic properties of the PHQ-9 using these methods. Results We found 27 validation studies that validated the algorithm scoring method of the PHQ-9 in various settings. There was substantial heterogeneity across studies, which makes the pooled results difficult to interpret. In general, sensitivity was low whereas specificity was good. Thirteen studies reported the diagnostic properties of the PHQ-9 for both scoring methods. Pooled sensitivity for algorithm scoring method was lower while specificities were good for both scoring methods. Heterogeneity was consistently high; therefore, caution should be used when interpreting these results. Interpretation This review shows that, if the algorithm scoring method is used, the PHQ-9 has a low sensitivity for detecting MDD. This could be due to the rating scale categories of the measure, higher specificity or other factors that warrant further research. The summed-item score method at proposed cut-off point of ≥10 has better diagnostic performance for screening purposes or where a high sensitivity is needed.

198,0,"A tool for visual and formal modelling of software designs Diagrams are ubiquitous in software engineering and widely used for software modelling. The visual contract language (VCL) enables an approach to software design modelling that is entirely graphical and has a mathematical basis. VCL's main novelties lie in its capacity to describe predicates visually and in its graphical front-end to formal modelling. VCL is brought to life in the visual contract builder (VCB) tool presented in this paper. VCB provides diagram editors for the whole VCL suite, it type-checks diagrams and generates Z formal specifications from them; the Z specification enables formal verification and validation using Z theorem provers.

199,0,"Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) in the treatment of major depression: An exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis Background Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a relatively new, non-invasive method of stimulating larger and, presumably, deeper brain regions. The current study investigated if DTMS delivered with H-coils has acute antidepressant effects in major depression using a systematic literature review and a quantitative meta-analysis. Methods Seventeen studies on `DTMS or H-coil' and `depression' were identified on Medline, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar (until November 2014). Data from nine open-label studies were meta-analysed using a random-effects model with inverse-variance weights. The outcome measures were the standardised paired mean difference (Cohen's d) in depression scores on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), response, remission, and dropout rates after acute DTMS treatment compared to baseline. Results There was a large antidepressant effect after 20 acute, high-frequency DTMS sessions compared to baseline according to HDRS change scores (overall mean weighted d=2.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.53--2.55; nine studies; 150 patients). Overall weighted response, remission, and dropout rates were 60%, 29%, and 18% respectively. HDRS change scores and response rates tended to be higher in four studies with 68 patients on concurrent antidepressants compared to two studies with 26 patients who received DTMS as a monotherapy. Limitations These results are based on data from a low number of open-label studies. Conclusion High-frequency DTMS appears to have acute antidepressant effects after 20 sessions in mostly unipolar and treatment-resistant patients.

200,0,"Differences in Quality of Life Outcomes Among Depressed Spinal Cord Injury Trial Participants Objective To assess the role that treatment response plays in a randomized controlled trial of an antidepressant among people with spinal cord injury (SCI) diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) in explaining quality of life (QOL), assessed both globally as life satisfaction and in terms of physical and mental health-related QOL. Design Multivariable analyses were conducted, controlling for demographic, neurologic, and participatory factors and perceived functional limitations. Setting Rehabilitation centers. Participants Of the 133 persons who were randomized into the Project to Improve Symptoms and Mood after Spinal Cord Injury randomized controlled trial, 124 participated in this study. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 64 years, at least 1 month post-SCI, met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, criteria for MDD, and completed the core measures used in this study. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures The Satisfaction with Life Scale and the physical and mental component summary scores of the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Results Reduction in depressive symptoms over the course of a 12-week trial was predictive of increased QOL, which was measured as life satisfaction and mental well-being, within the context of other explanatory factors. However, reduction in symptoms did not explain differences in physical well-being among those with MDD. Perceived functional disability explained all 3 indices of QOL. Conclusions Greater recognition has been given to QOL outcomes as endpoints of clinical trials because these often reflect participants' reported outcomes. Our findings support the association of QOL to the reduction of depression symptoms among trial participants. This association differs depending on how QOL is defined and measured, with stronger relations observed with life satisfaction and mental well-being among those diagnosed with MDD. The lack of association between depression and physical well-being may be explained by participants' subjective interpretation of physical well-being after SCI and their expectations and perceptions of improved physical health-related QOL based on the use of assistive technology. Consistent with our findings, pain is likely to play a role in decreasing physical QOL among those with incomplete injuries. Practicing caution is suggested in using physical well-being as an endpoint in trials among people with SCI.

201,0,"Does Mood Disorder Questionnaire identify sub-threshold bipolarity? Evidence studying worsening of quality of life Objective It is debated whether the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) can generate false positives by screening other disorders as bipolar, or identify sub-threshold bipolarity. The aim is to verify if Quality of Life (QoL) impairment in MQD positives in the community is due to MDQ positivity itself, or to psychiatric diagnosis associated with MDQ positivity (supporting the former hypothesis). Method Community survey. Sample randomized after stratification of the adult population in the records of seven Italian regions. Tools: MDQ; Short Form Health Survey (SF-12); semi-structured clinical interview carried out by clinicians. Results Positives at MDQ show worsening QoL with an attributable burden of 2.8$\pm$1.8 lower than in MDD (5.6$\pm$3.6, p<0.001) or Eating Disorders (4.4$\pm$6.6, p<0.03) and similar to Panic Disorder (2.9$\pm$0.9, p=0.44). The burden is lower in the middle-aged (25--59 years) than in the young (18--24) (4.65$\pm$4.5 vs 2.58$\pm$2.0, p=0.007) or in the elderly (≥60) (4.12$\pm$3.2; p=0.024). In the elderly the burden is independent from comorbid psychiatric disorders. Limitations This is a preliminary study based on one survey not designed to test this specific hypothesis, thus its results have a heuristic value only. Conclusions The worsening of QoL due to positivity at MDQ is largely independent from comorbid conditions, supporting the hypothesis that MDQ positivity identifies a specific area of suffering that is ``subthreshold`` to the psychiatric diagnosis, and relevant for public health.

202,0,"Epidemiology of MRI-defined vascular depression: A longitudinal, community-based study in Korean elders Background There are no cross-sectional or longitudinal epidemiological studies present on MRI-defined vascular depression in community populations. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence rates of both vascular and non-vascular late life depression (LLD) at baseline, to examine the natural course of LLD, and to investigate the influence of White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on depression after three years. Method The baseline study employed a two-stage design, Phase I population survey (n=783) and Phase II diagnostic evaluation (n=122). In the 3-year follow-up study, baseline participants completing the second phase were reassessed with the same methodology. WMHs severity was rated visually by the modified Fazekas scale and WMHs volume was calculated using an automated method. Results The prevalence rates of vascular major depressive disorder (MDD) and vascular non-major depressive disorder (nMDD) were 2.39% (56.2% of MDD) and 4.24% (34.0% of nMDD). Subjects with a score of 2 or more on the modified Fazekas scale in either deep white matter hyperintensities or subcortical gray matter ratings had an 8.1 times greater risk of developing a depressive disorder in the 3-year follow-up study. Greater Log WMHs volume (odds ratio=5.78, 95% CI, 1.04--31.72) at baseline was an independent predictor for depressive disorder in the 3-year assessment. Limitations Response rate and follow-up rate were relatively low. Conclusions Vascular depression is common and makes up about a half of MDD in elders.

SF-36v2 Health Survey outcomes from a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT00969709) were evaluated. Methods Prospective and post hoc analyses of SF-36 Mental and Physical Component Summaries (MCS, PCS), and individual domains compared pooled levomilnacipran ER doses (40, 80, 120mg/day) with placebo. Patients (18--65 years) had MDD, depressive episode ≥8 weeks, and Montgomery--Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score ≥30. SF-36 score changes from baseline to Week 8 were analyzed using ANCOVA and the observed cases approach (Intent-to-Treat [ITT] Population). Minimally important differences (MID) evaluated clinical relevance. Results Baseline MCS scores reflected marked mental deficits in the ITT Population (levomilnacipran ER=529; placebo=175). MCS change at Week 8 was significantly greater for levomilnacipran ER than placebo (LSMD [SE]=4.8 [1.5]; P=0.0011); MID exceeded the 3-point threshold. Baseline PCS scores suggested minimal physical deficits; no between-group difference at Week 8 was noted. LSMD was nominally statistically significant (P<0.05) for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo in 5 domains (General Health [2.44; P=0.0010], Vitality [2.48; P=0.0307], Social Functioning [3.25; P=0.0097], Role-Emotional [3.38; P=0.0078], Mental Health [4.34; P=0.0005]); changes in Vitality, Social Functioning, and Mental Health exceeded MID. Limitations The trial was limited by short duration; analyses were post hoc and adjustments were not made for multiplicity.

205,0,"Experimental design and statistical analyses of fish growth studies Every year, numerous studies are published that compare the effects of different factors on the growth of aquaculture fish. However, comparatively little attention has been given to the experimental designs of these studies --- in how many rearing units should each treatment be replicated, how many fish should be in each tank (n) and how should the data be analysed. The reliability of the results increases with increased replication and n. In reality, however, the experimental design must strike a balance between limited resources and the reliability of the statistical analysis. A survey of recent publications in Aquaculture suggests, that most (83%) aquaculture growth studies apply each treatment in triplicates with an average of 26 fish in each tank (range: 4 to 100). The minimum difference that can reliably be detected with statistical analyses is determined by the number of replications of each treatment, n, the variance of the data and the number of treatments applied. In the present study, we accumulated information on the variance of data in aquaculture growth studies on different species to estimate the minimum detectable difference and to assist researchers in designing experiments effectively. These results suggest that the variance is similar for different aquaculture species and, therefore, the same designs (level of replication and n) are suitable for studies on different species of fish. The minimum difference (MDD) in mean body-mass of different treatment groups that can be detected in a typical aquaculture study (triplicates, 25 fish in each tank and average variance) with 80% statistical power (less than 20% chance of Type II error) is around 26% of the grand mean. Increasing the n from 25 to 100 will reduce the MDD to 19% of the grand mean, while a further increase in n will have comparatively lesser effect. Increasing replication to quadruplicates or sextuplicates (with n as 100), will further reduce the MDD to 16% and 12% of the grand mean respectively. MDD under 10% of the grand mean is only possible when fish for the experiment are selected within a narrow size range to reduce variance. Simulations were performed, where samples (experiments) were repeatedly drawn from artificial populations with identical distribution and with the same experimental design as is commonly used in growth studies. Two of the populations had dose-dependent responses to treatment while one population showed no response to treatment. The resulting data was analysed with a mixed model ANOVA and by fitting either polynomials or asymptotic models to the data. Contrary to earlier suggestions, the critical treatment (minimum treatment to generate maximum response) estimated with the ANOVA approached more closely the population responses than did the critical treatments estimated with the non-linear models.

206,0,"Is depression associated with increased oxidative stress? A systematic review and meta-analysis Summary Background It has been suggested that depressed persons have increased oxidative stress and decreased anti-oxidant defences. 8-Hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and F2-isoprostanes, measures of oxidative DNA and lipid damage respectively, are among the most reliable oxidative stress markers, but studies on their association with depression show conflicting results. This meta-analysis quantifies the association between depression and these markers and explores factors that may explain inconsistencies in the results. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Studies assessing the association of 8-OHdG or F2-isoprostanes with elevated depressive symptoms, major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) were pooled in two random-effect models. Results The pooled effect size (Hedges' g) for the association of depression with oxidative stress was 0.31 (p=0.01, I2=75%) for 8-OHdG (10 studies, 1308 subjects) and 0.48 (p=0.001, I2=73%) for F2-isoprostanes (8 studies, 2471 subjects), indicating that both markers are increased in depression. There was no indication of publication bias for either marker. The F2-isoprostane results did not differ by type of depression, biological specimen, laboratory method or quality, however subgroup analyses in the 8-OHdG studies showed significantly stronger associations in plasma/serum vs. urine samples (p<0.01), in measurements performed with immuno-assay vs. chromatography--mass spectrometry (p<0.01) and weaker associations in high quality studies vs. low (p=0.02). Conclusion This meta-analysis finds that oxidative stress, as measured by 8-OHdG and F2-isoprostanes, is increased in depression.

Composition, subtyping and numerical characterisation of mono-species biofilm dynamics on stainless steel In order to find out how real Listeria monocytogenes-carrying biofilms are in industrial settings, a total of 270 environmental samples belonging to work surfaces from fish (n=123), meat (n=75) and dairy industries (n=72) were analysed in order to detect L. monocytogenes. 12 samples were positive for L. monocytogenes and a total of 18 different species were identified as accompanying microbiota in fish and meat industry. No L. monocytogenes was found in samples from dairy industry. Molecular characterisation combining results of AscI and ApaI macrorestriction PFGE assays yielded 7 different subtypes of L. monocytogenes sharing in 71.43% of cases the same serogroup (1/2a--3a). Results from dynamic numerical characterisation between L. monocytogenes monospecies biofilms on stainless steel (SS) using MATLAB-based tool BIOFILMDIVER demonstrated that except in isolate A1, in which a significant increase in the percentage of covered area (CA), average diffusion distance (ADD) and maximum diffusion distance (MDD) was observed after 120h of culture, no significant differences were observed in the dynamics of the rest of the L. monocytogenes isolates. Quantitative dual-species biofilm association experiments performed on SS indicated that L. monocytogenes cell counts presented lower values in mixed-species cultures with certain species at 24 and 48h compared with mono-species culture. However, they remained unaltered after 72h except when co-cultured with Serratia fonticola which presented differences in all sampling times and was also the dominant species within the dual-species biofilm.

208,0,"Prevalence and correlates of major depressive disorder and dysthymia in an eleven-year follow-up -- Results from the Finnish Health 2011 Survey Background Up-to-date epidemiological data on depressive disorders is needed to understand changes in population health and health care utilization. This study aims to assess the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia in the Finnish population and possible changes during the past 11 years. Methods In a nationally representative sample of Finns aged 30 and above (BRIF8901), depressive disorders were diagnosed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) in 2000 and 2011. To account for nonresponse, two methods were compared: multiple imputation (MI) utilizing data from the hospital discharge register and from the interview in 2000 and statistical weighting. Results The MI-corrected 12-month prevalence of MDD was 7.4% (95% CI 5.7--9.0) and of dysthymia was 4.5% (95% CI 3.1--5.9), whereas the corresponding figures using weights were 5.4% (95% CI 4.7--6.1) for MDD and 2.0% (95% CI 1.6--2.4) for dysthymia. Women (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.6--3.4) and unmarried people (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.2--2.0) had a higher risk of depressive disorders. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of depressive disorders during the follow-up period from 7.3% in 2000 to 9.6% in 2011. Prevalences were two percentage points higher, on average, when using MI compared to weighting. Hospital treatments for depressive disorders and other mental disorders were strongly associated with nonparticipation. Limitations The CIDI response rate dropped from 75% in 2000 to 57% in 2011, but this was accounted for by MI and weighting.

209,0,"Specific and common genes implicated across major mental disorders: A review of meta-analysis studies Major efforts have been directed at family-based association and case--control studies to identify the involvement of candidate genes in the major disorders of mental health. What remains unknown is whether candidate genes are associated with multiple disorders via pleiotropic mechanisms, and/or if other genes are specific to susceptibility for individual disorders. Here we undertook a review of genes that have been identified in prior meta-analyses examining specific genes and specific mental disorders that have core disruptions to emotional and cognitive function and contribute most to burden of illness-- major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders (AD, including panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder), schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A literature review was conducted up to end-March 2013 which included a total of 1519 meta-analyses across 157 studies reporting multiple genes implicated in one or more of the five disorders studied. A total of 134 genes (206 variants) were identified as significantly associated risk variants for MDD, AD, ADHD, SZ or BD. Null genetic effects were also reported for 195 genes (426 variants). 13 genetic variants were shared in common between two or more disorders (APOE e4, ACE Ins/Del, BDNF Val66Met, COMT Val158Met, DAOA G72/G30 rs3918342, DAT1 40-bp, DRD4 48-bp, SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR, HTR1A C1019G, MTHR C677T, MTHR A1298C, SLC6A4 VNTR and TPH1 218A/C) demonstrating evidence for pleiotrophy. Another 12 meta-analyses of GWAS studies of the same disorders were identified, with no overlap in genetic variants reported.

210,0,"Subjective memory and concentration deficits in medication-free, non-elderly Asians with major depressive disorder: Prevalence and their correlates Background Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) in major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent and correlated with disability. This study aimed to examine the prevalence rates and correlates of subjective memory deficit (SMD) and subjective concentration deficit (SCD) in medication-free, non-elderly Asians with MDD. Methods The SMD and SCD were assessed by using two items of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Other measurements of interest included the Montgomery--Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results Of 515 participants from China, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, 347 (67.4%) and 377 (73.2%) had SMD and SCD, respectively. In total, 420 participants (81.6%) had SMD alone, SCD alone, and both deficits. Severe depression and poor mental health were significant correlates of SMD. Severe depression, clinically significant disability, poor physical health, and poor mental health were significantly independent correlates of SCD. Compared with young adults (18--34 years), older adults aged 50--65 years had a significantly lower risk of SCD (OR=.33, 95% CI: .19--.57). Limitations Only two SCL-90-R items were used to assess the SMD and SCD. The exclusion of MDD patients treated with psychotropic medications eliminated many patients commonly seen in typical clinic settings. Conclusion SMD and SCD are prevalent in medication-free, non-elderly Asians with MDD. Both deficits are correlated with depression and mental health status. The independent correlation between SCD and disability underscores the crucial role of SCI in MDD.

211,0,"The effect of mental health on long-term health-related quality of life following a road traffic crash: Results from the UQ SuPPORT study Background Most research on the consequences of road traffic crashes (RTCs) has focused on serious injury cohorts, yet RTC survivors with minor injury are also affected. This study investigates the relationship between mental health and health-related quality of life (QoL) following an RTC for those with predominately minor injuries. Methods A longitudinal cohort design with an opt-in consenting procedure was used. A letter of invitation was sent to 3146 claimants within the Compulsory Third Party (CTP) motor vehicle insurance scheme in Queensland, Australia, with a total of 382 (12%) responding to the invitation and consenting to participate in the study. Retention was high (65%) at 24 months. Survey and telephone interview data were collected at approximately 6, 12 and 24 months post-RTC. Health-related QoL (SF-36 v2) data from at least one wave was known for 343 participants. The sample was predominantly female (62%), with an average age of 48.6 years. Results Participants consistently reported physical and mental health-related QoL below Australian norms. A multilevel regression analysis found overall physical health-related QoL improved with higher expectations of returning to work, but was lower with age, increasing pain, expectations of persistent pain, heightened perceived threat to life, and the presence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Major Depressive Episode (MDE). Overall, mental health-related QoL did not improve with time, was higher with increased social support and expectations of returning to work, but was lower with increasing pain and the presence of PTSD, MDE or Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Contrary to expectations, lower injury severity was related to poorer mental health-related QoL. Conclusions Individuals with predominately minor RTC-related injuries have poor physical and mental health-related QoL, particularly when pain levels are high and comorbid psychiatric disorders are present. Of particular concern is that the low levels of reported health-related QoL do not appear to improve by 2 years post-RTC. The potential risk factors found in this study may be useful indicators for early identification and enhanced rehabilitation of those at risk of poor recovery.

212,0,"The Effect of Vortioxetine on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder Purpose Major depressive disorder (MDD) has detrimental effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We describe the effect of vortioxetine on HRQoL in MDD patients by using patient-reported outcome instruments. Methods HRQoL was evaluated in 5 short-term (6--8 weeks), randomized studies of vortioxetine (5--20 mg/d; n = 2155) versus placebo (n = 1316) in adults with MDD by using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire--Short Form, the EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and the 12-item Health Status Questionnaire in 1 study in elderly patients. Only patients receiving the approved doses of vortioxetine 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d were included in the analysis. A random effects meta-analysis was performed on the 4 adult MDD studies that used the SF-36. A within-studies mixed model for repeated measures analysis based on the full analysis set (FAS) was used unless otherwise specified. Standardized effect size (SES) was calculated to reflect clinical relevance, based on a Cohen's d of 0.2. Findings Vortioxetine produced significantly better results compared with placebo in the SF-36 mental component summary score (5 mg: 2.6, P = 0.001, SES of 0.22, n = 604; 10 mg: 4.8, P < 0.001, SES of 0.42, n = 328) and 4 domain scores (vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Vortioxetine was also significantly better in the EuroQoL-5 Dimension Questionnaire Health State score (10 mg: 7.5, P < 0.05, SES of 0.33, n = 86) and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire--Short Form total score (15 mg: 3.3, P < 0.01, SES of 0.38, n = 127; 20 mg: 4.5, P < 0.0001, SES of 0.52, n = 134) (FAS, last-observation-carried-forward).

213,0,"The patterns of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in depression patients: The dissociation between temporal regions and fronto-parietal regions Objective This study surveyed the characteristics of the indicator for the fluctuations of default brain activity, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), in patients with pure major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Forty-four patients with MDD and 27 normal controls were enrolled in our study. All the participants received the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans, which were pre-processed by the REST toolbox (resting-state functional MRI data analysis toolbox). The group-related differences of the fALFF between patients and controls were explored by performing comparisons of the fALFF values obtained from rs-fMRI data. The fALFF outputs of patients and controls were compared with global brain volume, age and gender as covariates. In addition, the correlations between the clinical variables (such as depression severity, anxiety severity, illness duration) and fALFF values were also estimated in each group and across both groups. Results The patients with MDD had significantly higher fALFF values than the controls, for the left temporal subgyral region. In the contrary, the patients had lower values of fALFF than controls, for the right frontal subcallosal gyrus and right parietal postcentral gyrus. In addition, the fALFF values were negatively correlated with the depression severity in the left temporal subgyral region.

214,0,"Agitated ``unipolar'' depression re-conceptualized as a depressive mixed state: implications for the antidepressant-suicide controversy Background The nosologic status of agitated depression is unresolved. Are they unipolar (UP) or bipolar (BP)? Are they mixed states? Even more controversial is the notion that antidepressants might play some role in the suicidality of such patients (Akiskal and Mallya, 1987) [Akiskal, H.S., Mallya, G., 1987. Criteria for the ``soft'' bipolar spectrum: treatment implications. Psychopharmacol Bull. 23, 68--73]. Methods After excluding all patients with history of hypomanic episodes occurring outside the frame of a major depressive episode (MDE), even those with a shorter duration of hypomanic symptoms than stipulated in DSM-IV, the remaining consecutive 254 unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) private adult (>21 years old) outpatients were interviewed (off psychoactive drugs for 2 weeks) with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-CV), the Hypomania Interview Guide (HIGH-C), and the Family History Screen. Intra-MDE hypomanic symptoms were systematically assessed, with ≥3 such symptoms required for a diagnosis of depressive mixed state (DMX). Agitated depression was defined as an MDE with HIGH-C psychomotor agitation score ≥2. Logistic regression was used to study associations and control for confounding variables. Results In this strictly defined unipolar sample, agitated depression was present in 19.7%. Compared with its non-agitated counterpart, it had significantly fewer recurrences, less chronicity, higher rate of family history for bipolar disorder, and DMX; and, among the intra-depressive non-euphoric hypomanic symptoms (in decreasing order of frequency), distractibility, racing/crowded thoughts, irritable mood, talkativeness, and risky behavior. The most striking finding was the robust association between agitated depression and DMX (OR=36.9). Furthermore, patients with psychomotor agitation had significantly higher rate of weight loss and suicidal ideation. Of DMX symptoms, we found an association between suicidal ideation, psychomotor activation, and racing thoughts. Agitated depression was tested by forward stepwise logistic regression versus all variables significantly different in the pairwise comparisons, yielding DMX, talkativeness, and suicidal ideation as the independent significant positive predictors. Limitations No suicidal ideation scale was used. Conclusions Agitated depression emerges as a distinct affective syndrome with weight loss, pressure of speech, racing thoughts and suicidal ideation. Psychomotor activation and racing thoughts during MDD independently predicted suicidal ideation. In this ``unipolar'' MDD sample, agitated depression had a strong clustering of intra-episode non-euphoric hypomanic symptoms (i.e. DMX) which, coupled with its association with bipolar family history, support its link with the bipolar spectrum. Agitated depression is therefore best regarded as ``pseudo-unipolar.'' These findings overall accord with classical German concepts of agitated depression as a mixed state. Given that these patients are typically activated along the lines of risk-taking behavior, Kraepelin's rubric of ``excited (mixed) depression'' appears to us the preferred terminology over ``agitated depression''. Clinical implications The data reported herein, placed in the setting of the literature reviewed in the discussion suggest that the reports of increased risk of suicidal ideation and/or behavior in some depressed patients treated by antidepressant monotherapy or combinations thereof might be attributed to baseline psychomotor activation/agitation as part of an unrecognized bipolar mixed state. Whether antidepressants induce de novo suicidality in MDD cannot be answered without adequately powered prospective double-blind studies, unlikely to be conducted because of ethical constraints. Nonetheless, we submit that agitated, activated, or otherwise excited depressions (which we consider as depressive mixed states) overlap considerably with the so-called antidepressant ``activation syndrome.'' Furthermore, the rare occurrence of suicidality on antidepressants should not obscure the fact that the advent of the new antidepressants is associated with worldwide decline in suicide rates. We finally wish to point out that our formal nosology (i.e. DSM-IV and ICD-10), in its failure to recognize the bipolar nature of depressive mixed states, thereby fails to shield pseudo-unipolar patients from antidepressant monotherapy, which is inappropriate for such patients.

215,0,"A survey of approaches for the visual model-driven development of next generation software-intensive systems Software-intensive systems of the future are expected to be highly distributed and to exhibit adaptive and anticipatory behavior when operating in highly dynamic environments and interfacing with the physical world. Therefore, visual modeling techniques to address these software-intensive systems require a mix of models from a multitude of disciplines such as software engineering, control engineering, and business process engineering. As in this concert of techniques software provides the most flexible element, the integration of these different views can be expected to happen in the software. The software thus includes complex information processing capabilities as well as hard real-time coordination between distributed technical systems and computers.

216,0,"Temperament among offspring at high and low risk for depression The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between parental depression, offspring temperament, and offspring major depressive disorder (MDD), and to determine whether difficult temperament, as measured by the Dimensions of Temperament Survey (DOTS), mediates the relation between parental MDD and offspring MDD. Offspring (n=169) of depressed or never depressed parents were followed over approximately 20 years and were blindly assessed up to 4 times (Waves 1 to 4) using semi-structured interviews. Offspring completed the DOTS at the time of first or second assessment. The results showed: (1) high-risk offspring with one or more depressed parent were significantly more likely than offspring with neither parent depressed to have a difficult temperament; (2) offspring with a difficult temperament were more than twice as likely as those with an easy temperament to develop a MDD; and (3) difficult temperament explained more than 10% of the association between parental depression and new onsets of MDD in offspring. The findings suggest that offspring temperament is associated with development of MDD and that difficult temperament at least partially mediates the relationship between parental depression and offspring depression. When identifying those at greatest risk for MDD, measures of temperament could serve as a useful supplement to family psychiatric history of MDD.

Methods The data source was the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The NPHS included a brief instrument to assess MDEs and collected data on participation in recreational activities. In order to meaningfully categorize participation in recreational activities, the participation data was translated into overall estimated metabolic energy expenditure. A threshold of 1.5 kcal/kg per day was used to distinguish between active and inactive activity patterns. Proportional hazards models were used to compare the incidence of inactivity in initially active respondents with and without MDE and to compare the frequency of becoming active among initially inactive respondents with and without MDE. Results For active respondents with MDE, an elevated risk of transition into an inactive pattern was observed [adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.6; 95% CI 1.2--1.9]. However, MDE did not affect the probability of moving from an inactive to an active lifestyle (adjusted HR=1.0; 95% CI 0.78--1.19).

Pharmacotherapy Background In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008--2009 to reflect advances in the field. Methods The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question--answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included Levels of Evidence and expert clinical support. This section on ``Pharmacotherapy'' is one of 5 guideline articles. Results Despite emerging data on efficacy and tolerability differences amongst newer antidepressants, variability in patient response precludes identification of specific first choice medications for all patients. All second-generation antidepressants have Level 1 evidence to support efficacy and tolerability and most are considered first-line treatments for MDD. First-generation tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants are not the focus of these guidelines but generally are considered second- or third-line treatments. For inadequate or incomplete response, there is Level 1 evidence for switching strategies and for add-on strategies including lithium and atypical antipsychotics. Limitations Most of the evidence is based on trials for registration and may not reflect real-world effectiveness. Conclusions Second-generation antidepressants are safe, effective and well tolerated treatments for MDD in adults. Evidence-based switching and add-on strategies can be used to optimize response in MDD that is inadequately responsive to monotherapy.

Method The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing is a population-based epidemiological survey which utilized the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument to diagnose MDE. Analyses were based on the survey respondents who endorsed either (or both) the ``depressed mood'' or ``loss of interest'' core MDE symptoms (60+ years, n=278; 40+ years, n=1020). A series of multivariate linear regression analyses were run to assess the relationship between the number and the type of depressive symptoms and five measures of impairment. Results For those aged 60+ years, a linear relationship alone was observed for the relationship between the number of depressive symptoms and each of the five measures but not all symptoms of depression were equal predictors of impairment; loss of energy was the most consistent predictor. When the regression analyses were repeated using respondents aged 40+ years, consistent significant interactions between age and individual symptoms of depression were not observed. Limitations The dimensionality of MDE is assessed focusing solely on symptoms. Conclusions Our data illustrate the apparent dimensional structure of MDE and the differential impact of depressive symptoms on impairment in an elderly sub-sample.

Summary of revisions:1.Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) is the approach defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) for software development under the Model-Driven Engineering framework [1]. The MDA approach shifts the focus of software development from writing code to building models. By adapting a model-centric approach, the MDA approach hopes to automate the generation of system implementation artifacts directly from the model. The following three models are the core of the MDA: (i) the Computation Independent Model (CIM), which is focused on basic requirements of the system, (ii) the Platform Independent Model (PIM), which is used by software architects and designers, and is focused on the operational capabilities of a system outside the context of a specific platform, and (iii) the Platform Specific Model (PSM), which is used by software developers and programmers, and includes details relating to the system for a specific platform. Basic requirements for the calculation of the RHEED intensity rocking curves in the one-beam condition have been described in Ref. [2]. Fig. 1 shows the PIM for the present version of the program. Fig. 2 presents the PSM for the program.2.The TGraph2D.bpk package has been recompiled to Graph2D0x.bpl and upgraded according to C++0x language standards. Fig. 3 shows the PSM of the Graph2D component, which is manifested by the Graph2D0x.bpl package presently. This diagram is a graphic presentation of the static view, which shows a collection of declarative model elements and their relationships. Installation instructions of the Graph2D0x package can be found in the new distribution.3.The program requires the user to provide the appropriate parameters for the crystal structure under investigation. These parameters are loaded from the parameters.ini file at run-time. Instructions for the preparation of the .ini files can be found in the new distribution.4.The program enables carrying out one-dimensional dynamical calculations for the fcc lattice, with a two-atoms basis and fcc lattice, with one atom basis but yet the zeroth Fourier component of the scattering potential in the TRHEED1D::crystPotUg() function can be modified according to users' specific application requirements.5.A graphical user interface (GUI) for the program has been reconstructed.6.The program has been compiled with English/USA regional and language options. Unusual features: The program is distributed in the form of main projects RHEEDGr_09.cbproj and Graph2D0x.cbproj with associated files, and should be compiled using Code Gear C++ Builder 2009 compilers. Running time: The typical running time is machine and user-parameters dependent.

221,0,"Prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of major depressive episode in rural and urban areas of Beijing, China Objective This study aimed to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) and their socio-demographic correlates in both the urban and rural areas of Beijing, China. Methods A total of 4767 adults were randomly selected and interviewed in Beijing using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0). Basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected during the interviews. Results The overall 12-month prevalence of MDE was 3.2%; 2.8% and 3.8% for men and women, respectively. The overall lifetime prevalence of MDE was 5.3%; 4.4% and 6.3% for men and women, respectively. Being older than 25 years of age was independently associated with increased risk of MDE. Sixteen point three percent of the subjects with lifetime MDE attempted suicide while the rate of suicide attempts was only 0.2% in subjects without MDE. The percentage of subjects with MDE who received any type of treatment from medical practitioners was 33.1%; of them, only 5.4% sought help from mental health professionals. Conclusions National epidemiologic surveys are needed to further explore the prevalence of MDE in China. The low percentage of subjects treated for MDE constitutes a major public health problem that should be urgently addressed.

222,0,"Concordance between telephone survey classification and face-to-face interview diagnosis of one-year major depressive episode in Hong Kong Background Community-based telephone surveys of depression have generated reliable findings but their concordance with standardized clinical diagnostic interviews is uncommonly examined, especially in non-western populations. Method 106 consenting participants from a previous telephone-based population survey of major depressive episode (MDE) using a structured questionnaire were re-assessed face-to-face by clinical interviewers using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorder (SCID-I). Receiver operating characteristic and other predictive indicators were used to investigate the concordance between the telephone survey instrument and SCID interview. Result The telephone survey instrument adequately classified MDE when the DSM-IV symptom number standard was fulfilled at moderate to severe levels of distress and impairment. It performed best when the cut-off was set at a severe level of distress or impairment in any one of four domains of functioning (AUC=0.76). Feeling useless, fatigue, loss of motivation and difficulty in concentration were the most prominent items for increasing the certainty of SCID-MDE diagnosis. Conclusion Classification of MDE by telephone-based structured interview of MDE exhibited generally good agreement with face-to-face clinical interview diagnosis in the Chinese population of Hong Kong. Further research on the telephone-based methodology should address inter-rater reliability, specificity of diagnosis, and variability of concordance across different mental disorder diagnoses and criteria of clinically significant impairment.

223,0,"Depression in adult Nigerians: Results from the Nigerian Survey of Mental Health and Well-being Background Community-based studies of the rates and profile of depression among Africans are still sparse. Methods As part of the World Mental Health Surveys initiative, a clustered multi-stage sampling of households in 21 of Nigeria's 36 states (representing 57% of the national population) was implemented to select adults aged 18 years and over (N=6752) for face-to-face interviews using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Diagnosis of major depressive episode (MDE) was based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition. Results Lifetime and 12-month estimates of MDE were 3.1% (standard error 0.3) and 1.1% (s.e. 0.1), receptively. Increasing age was associated with higher estimates of positive responses to stem (screen) questions for depression and of lifetime disorders among stem-positive respondents. The mean age of onset was about 29.2 years. The median (inter quantile range, IQR) duration of an episode among lifetime cases was 1.0 (2.0--2.4) year and the median (IQR) number of lifetime episodes was 1.5 (2.0--2.8). MDE was highly comorbid with anxiety disorders, musculoskeletal conditions, chronic pain and ulcer. The odds ratio of lifetime suicide attempt among persons with lifetime MDE was 11.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.9--34.9). Over 25% of 12-month cases were rated as severely disabled in the performance of usual roles. Only 16.9% (s.e. 5.0) of 12-month cases had received any treatment. Limitations All data were based on self-reports. Conclusion MDE, defined according to DSM-IV, is a risk factor for mental and physical comorbidity as well as disability in Nigerians.

224,0,"Epidemiology of major depressive episode in a southern European country: Results from the ESEMeD-Spain project Background Information of the epidemiology of Major Depressive Episode (MDE) in Spain, one of the biggest southern European countries, is scarce and heterogeneous. The objective of this study was to assess the epidemiology of the disorder in the Spanish sample of the ESEMeD project. Methods The ESEMED-Spain project is a cross-sectional, general population, household survey conducted with a representative sample of Spanish non-institutionalized adult population. The survey instrument was the CIDI 3.0, a structured diagnostic interview to assess disorders and treatment. Results Lifetime prevalence was 10.6% while 12-month prevalence was 4.0%. A monotonic increase in lifetime overall prevalence was found from the youngest to the 50--64 cohort, declining then in the oldest group. Median age of onset was 30.0. Being a woman (OR=2.7), previously married (OR=1.8), unemployed or disabled to work (OR=2.9) was associated to higher risk of 12-month-MDE. The highest comorbid associations were with dysthymia (OR=73.1) and panic disorder (OR=41.8). Limitations 1. Psychiatric diagnoses were made by trained lay interviewers and this could have an imperfect sensitivity/specificity; 2. Individuals with mental illness could have more frequently rejected to participate in the survey; 3. Age-related recall bias could have affected the accuracy of age of onset estimates. Conclusions The study shows that prevalence MDE in Spain is lower than in other Western countries. Important findings are the early age of onset, the high proportion of chronicity, and the high female/male ratio.

225,0,"Functional disability as an explanation of the associations between chronic physical conditions and 12-month major depressive episode Background The link between physical conditions and mental health is poorly understood. Functional disability could explain the association of physical conditions with major depressive episode (MDE) as an intermediary factor. Methods Data was analyzed from a subsample (N=8796) of the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), a cross-sectional general population survey. MDE during the last 12months was assessed using a revision of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Lifetime chronic physical conditions were assessed by self-report. Functional disability was measured using a version of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS). The associations of physical conditions with MDE and explanation by functional disability were quantified using logistic regression. Results All physical conditions were significantly associated with MDE. The increases in risk of MDE ranged from 30% for allergy to amply 100% for arthritis and heart disease. When adjusted for physical comorbidity, associations decreased and were no longer statistically significant for allergy and diabetes. Functional disability explained between 17 and 64% of these associations, most substantially for stomach or duodenum ulcer, arthritis and heart disease. Limitations Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study the temporal relationship of the variables could not be assessed and the amount of explanation cannot simply be interpreted as the amount of mediation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the association of chronic physical conditions with MDE is partly explained by functional disability. Such explanation is more pronounced for pain causing conditions and heart disease. Health professionals should be particularly aware of the increased risk of depressive disorder when patients experience disability from these conditions.

Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 2394 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No Nature of problem: An application that implements numerical simulations should be constructed according to the CSFAR rules: clear and well-documented, simple, fast, accurate, and robust. A clearly written, externally and internally documented program is much easier to understand and modify. A simple program is much less prone to error and is more easily modified than one that is complicated. Simplicity and clarity also help make the program flexible. Making the program fast has economic benefits. It also allows flexibility because some of the features that make a program efficient can be traded off for greater accuracy. Making the program fast also has the benefit of allowing longer calculations with better resolution. The compromise between speed and accuracy has always posted one of the most troublesome challenges for the programmer. Almost all advances in numerical analysis have come about trying to reach these twin goals. Change in the basic algorithms will give greater improvements in accuracy and speed than using special numerical tricks or changing programming language. A robust program works correctly over a broad spectrum of input data. Solution method: The computational model of the program is based on the use of a dynamical diffraction theory in which the electrons are taken to be diffracted by a potential, which is periodic in the dimension perpendicular to the surface. In the case of a disordered surface we can use the proportional model of the scattering potential, in which the potential of a partially filled layer is taken to be the product of the coverage of this layer and the potential of a fully filled layer:Un(θ,z)=∑n∑iθn(ti/τ)Un(1,zi), where Un(1,zi) stands for the potential for the full nth layer, and Un(θ,z) the potential of the growing layer. Reasons for new version: Responding to the user feedback the RHEEDGr_09 program has been upgraded to a standard that allows carrying out computations of the RHEED intensities for a disordered surface. Also, functionality and documentation of the program have been improved. Summary of revisions:1.The logical structure of the Platform-Specific Model of the RHEEDGr_09 program has been modified according to the scheme showed in Fig. 1*. The class diagram in Fig. 1* is a static view of the main platform-specific elements of the RHEED1DProcess architecture. Fig. 2* provides a dynamic view by showing the creation and destruction simplistic sequence diagram for the process. Fig. 3* shows the RHEED1DProcess use case model.2.As can be seen in Fig. 2, Fig. 3* the RHEED1DProcess has been designed as a slave process that runs as a separate thread inside each transaction generated by the master Growth09 program (see A. Daniluk, Model-Driven Development for scientific computing. Computations of RHEED intensities for a disordered surface. Part II).3.The RHEED1DProcess requires the user to provide the appropriate parameters for the crystal structure under investigation. These parameters are loaded from the parameters.ini file at run-time. Instructions on the preparation of the .ini files can be found in the new distribution.4.The RHEED1DProcess requires the user to provide the appropriate values of the layers of coverage profiles. The CoverageProfiles.dat file (generated by Growth09 master application) at run-time loads these values.5.The RHEED1DProcess enables carrying out one-dimensional dynamical calculations for the fcc lattice, with a two-atoms basis and fcc lattice, with one atom basis but yet the zeroth Fourier component of the scattering potential in the TRHEED1D::crystPotUg() function can be modified according to users' specific application requirements. * The figures mentioned can be downloaded, see ``Supplementary material'' below. Unusual features: The program is distributed in the form of main projects RHEED1DProcess.cbproj and Graph2D0x.cbproj with associated files, and should be compiled using Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010 along with Together visual-modelling platform. The program should be compiled with English/USA regional and language options. Additional comments: This version of the RHEED program is designed to run in conjunction with the GROWTH09 (ADVL_v3_0) program. It does not replace the previous, stand alone, RHEEDGR-09 (ADUY_v3_0) version. Running time: The typical running time is machine and user-parameters dependent.

227,0,"Negative association of concomitant physical symptoms with the course of major depressive disorder: A systematic review Objective The prognosis of depression greatly varies among patients, and the physical symptoms that often accompany depression may predict treatment resistance and a worse outcome. If so, this may have important clinical implications. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the association of concomitant physical symptoms with the outcome of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Systematic review: Medline, Psychinfo, and the Cochrane Library were searched for prospective, cross-sectional, and retrospective studies, and also for open-label trials and randomized controlled trials. The risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed in duplicate. A qualitative best-evidence synthesis was performed, based on the number of studies reporting on the association between physical symptoms and the course of MDD, the consistency of the results, and the methodological quality.

228,0,"Single versus recurrent depression history: Differentiating risk factors among current US smokers Introduction The strong relationship between persistent tobacco use and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has motivated clinical trials of specialized treatments targeting smokers with a history of MDD. Meta-analyses suggest positive responses to specialized treatments have been observed consistently among smokers with history of recurrent rather than a single episode of MDD. Approximately 15% of current US smokers have a history of recurrent MDD. Little is known about the risk factors that contribute to persistent smoking and differentiate these at-risk smokers, US. Methods The National Comorbidity Survey -- Replication (NCS-R) included a survey of 1560 smokers participants aged 18 and older in the United States. Lifetime history of MDD was categorized according to chronicity: no history (No MDD), single episode (MDD-S) and recurrent depression (MDD-R). The relationship between the chronicity of MDD, smoking characteristics, cessation history, nicotine dependence, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders, and current functional impairments were examined. Results MDD-R smokers reported fewer lifetime cessation efforts, smoked more cigarettes, had higher levels of nicotine dependence, had higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders and greater functional impairment than smokers with No MDD. MDD-S smokers were not consistently distinguished from No MDD smokers on cessation attempts, level of daily smoking, nicotine dependence or functional impairment indices. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of chronicity when characterizing depression-related risk of persistent smoking behavior.

The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture as monotherapy and as an additional therapy in treating various depressive conditions, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-stroke depression (PSD). Methods Following systematic review, meta-analysis was conducted on high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results Of 207 clinical studies of acupuncture for various depression retrieved, 113 (54.6%) were on MDD and 76 (36.7%) on PSD. Twenty RCTs of MDD (n=1998) and 15 of PSD (n=1680) identified for high-quality protocol (Jadad score ≥3) were included for meta-analysis. The efficacy of acupuncture as monotherapy was comparable to antidepressants alone in improving clinical response and alleviating symptom severity of MDD, but not different from sham acupuncture. No sufficient evidence favored the expectation that acupuncture combined with antidepressants could yield better outcomes than antidepressants alone in treating MDD. Acupuncture was superior to antidepressants and waitlist controls in improving both response and symptom severity of PSD. The incidence of adverse events in acupuncture intervention was significantly lower than antidepressants. Conclusions Acupuncture therapy is safe and effective in treating MDD and PSD, and could be considered an alternative option for the two disorders.

230,0,"The incidence of major depression in Canada: The National Population Health Survey Objectives To estimate the cumulative incidence of major depressive episode (MDE) over 6 years and the associations between demographic and socioeconomic variables and MDE in a sample of the Canadian national population. Methods Data from the longitudinal cohort of the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) were used. MDE was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview --- Short Form for Major Depression. Participants of the 2000/01 NPHS were followed until 2006/07. Individuals with previous MDE were excluded from the analysis. Proportional hazard models were developed to assess the associations between demographic, socioeconomic characteristics and MDE. Results The cumulative incidence of MDE at 2002/03, 2004/05 and 2006/07 was 2.9% (95% confidence interval: 2.3%, 3.4%), 5.7% (95% confidence interval: 4.9%, 6.4%) and 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 6.4%, 8.1%). Women, youth, participants with one or more chronic medical conditions and those who reported family history of MDE were more likely to have developed MDE. Family history was the strongest risk factor for MDE (hazard ratio=2.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.51, 2.68). Conclusion It may be valuable for primary and secondary prevention efforts to target women and young people.

Yet, the available evidence is mixed regarding the implications of C-ALDP for alcohol involvement. The purpose of this research was to examine the associations between past 12-month co-occurring AUDs (abuse and dependence) and major depressive episode (MDE) and alcohol involvement in a representative community sample. Design The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) is a national household survey of 43,093 adults ages 18 and older. For the NESARC, the target population is the civilian noninstitutionalized population, 18 years of age and older, living in the United States and the District of Columbia. Methods All NESARC interviews were conducted with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule -- DSM IV Version (AUDADIS-IV; Grant et al., 2003a). Results Prevalence of past 12-month co-occurring AUD (abuse or dependence) and MDE was 1.2%, corresponding to about 2.4million adults ages 18 and older. Among males with alcohol dependence, comorbid MDE was associated with a greater number of days drinking at home alone. Among females and males with alcohol abuse and dependence, comorbid MDE was associated with higher prevalence of drinking to enhance depressed mood. Comorbid MDE was also associated with lower levels of some drinking behaviors among those with alcohol abuse. Conclusions Co-occurring AUDs and MDE are associated with specific dimensions of alcohol involvement, and this association is more consistent for alcohol dependence than abuse.

Participants were adults in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication sample who met DSM criteria for at least one lifetime MDE (n=1829). Diagnostic assessments were conducted using structured interviews. The following MDE subtypes were examined: atypical, psychomotor agitation, psychomotor retardation, melancholic, and suicidal. The results indicated that: (1) suicidal MDEs were associated with increased risk for all SUDs; (2) melancholic MDEs were associated with increased risk for alcohol use disorders; and (3) psychomotor agitation was associated with increased risk for alcohol dependence. These associations did not differ significantly by gender. Adjusting for age, the severity of the MDE, the age of onset of the first MDE, and psychiatric comorbidity did not substantially change the results. Supplemental analyses examining only diagnoses that occurred in the year prior to the assessment demonstrated a similar pattern (with MDEs characterized by psychomotor agitation being associated with drug use disorders as well). Exploratory order of onset analyses indicated that participants with lifetime MDEs and SUDs tended to report an MDE onset prior to the SUD onset, and those who experienced a suicidal MDE at some time in their lives were particularly likely to have had their first MDE prior to developing a SUD. Therefore, risk for lifetime SUDs differs according to the particular set of symptoms experienced during MDEs.

Evaluation of clinical effectiveness of treatments for depression must include improvement in these important functional outcomes. However, clinical trials for depression have primarily focused on reduction in symptoms, as measured by symptom severity scales such as the HDRS and MADRS or by standard definitions of response and remission. Method The rationale and necessity for accessing both symptom and functional outcomes in clinical trials for MDD are reviewed, and examples of validated scales for measuring QoL and social and occupational functioning are provided. Results Emerging data suggest that treatment effects assessed with functioning scales may differ from those captured by symptoms scales. Many validated scales are available to measure global and specific aspects of functional outcomes, including QoL, psychosocial functioning and occupational functioning. Nevertheless, systematic reviews have shown that functional outcome scales are used in fewer than 5% of trials.

This study presents nationally representative data on the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of depression in women during pregnancy and postpartum in the United States. Method Data were drawn from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC is a survey of 43,093 adults aged 18years and older residing in households in the United States of whom 14,549 were women 18 to 50years old with known past-year pregnancy status. Diagnoses of depression and other mood, anxiety, and drug disorders were based on the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule --- DSM-IV version. Results The overall prevalence of MDE during pregnancy was 12.4%. Among pregnant and postpartum women, depression was associated with younger age, ethnicity other than Latino, being widowed, divorced, separated or never married, traumatic events within the past 12months and pregnancy complication. Strong associations were found between MDE during pregnancy and postpartum and nearly all 12-month psychiatric disorders. Past-year depressed pregnant and postpartum women were more likely than nondepressed pregnant women to use substances (including alcohol, illicit drugs and cigarettes). Past-year pregnant and postpartum women were significantly less likely to receive past-year treatment for depression than nonpregnant women although not after adjusting for background sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions These results indicate that depression during pregnancy and postpartum is associated with a large range of psychiatric disorders.

The NPHS includes the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form for Major Depression (CIDI-SFMD). Self-reported height and weight are also recorded. Linear regression was used to describe associations between weight, BMI and MDE. Results The pattern of weight change varied by age. Respondents under the age of 65 tended to gain weight over time, whereas those over the age of 65 tended to lose weight. Respondents in the younger category gained more weight if they had MDE or took antidepressant medications. However, the extent of weight gain was modest, those with MDE and those taking an antidepressant gaining an average of approximately 1kg over 12years of follow-up. Limitations The study used self-reported weight, which may be inaccurate. Measurements were made two years apart. The measure of MDE was an abbreviated diagnostic interview. Conclusions Both MDE and antidepressant medication use are associated with a modest increase in weight in people under 65. These results may be useful for physicians and other health professionals in planning dietary and weight-management regimens for depressed patients.

238,0,"Common and distinct neural correlates of emotional processing in Bipolar Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder: A voxel-based meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies Neuroimaging studies have consistently shown functional brain abnormalities in patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, the extent to which these two disorders are associated with similar or distinct neural changes remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing BD and MDD patients to healthy participants using facial affect processing paradigms. Relevant spatial coordinates from twenty original studies were subjected to quantitative Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analyses based on 168 BD and 189 MDD patients and 344 healthy controls. We identified common and distinct patterns of neural engagement for BD and MDD within the facial affect processing network. Both disorders were associated with increased engagement of limbic regions. Diagnosis-specific differences were observed in cortical, thalamic and striatal regions. Decreased ventrolateral prefrontal cortical engagement was associated with BD while relative hypoactivation of the sensorimotor cortices was seen in MDD. Increased responsiveness in the thalamus and basal ganglia were associated with BD. These findings were modulated by stimulus valence. These data suggest that whereas limbic overactivation is reported consistently in patients with mood disorders, future research should consider the relevance of a wider network of regions in formulating conceptual models of BD and MDD.

Methods The European Study of Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD)-Spain is a cross-sectional, general-population, household survey representative of the Spanish noninstitutionalized adult population (N=5473). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used for assessing mental disorders. CPCs were assessed among a subsample (N=2121) with a standardized checklist. Logistic regression analysis was performed. ESEMeD-Spain is part of the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. Results Among those with CPC, the prevalence of MDE was 5.9%, and the odds ratio (OR) of comorbid MDE was 2.2 compared with those without CPC. The strongest association with MDE was for respiratory disorders (OR up to 7.8). Having an MDE increased notably the odds of disability among those with a CPC (ORs ranged from 3.6 to 23.0). The likelihood of receiving treatment for the MDE was similar irrespective of having or not comorbid CPC. Conclusions Results show intense associations among MDE and CPC. Compared to other developed countries, higher likehoods of comorbidity and more severe impacts on disability are found in specific comorbid conditions. These findings highlight the need to improve the treatment of MDE in those with a CPC in Spain.

Since these characteristics may be associated with obesity and diabetes, we examined whether individuals with MDD with atypical features (MDD-AD) are more likely to exhibit cardiovascular disease than those with MDD without atypical features (MDD-NAD). Methods Participants in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized US adults, were categorized as having no lifetime depression diagnosis (n=34,979), MDD-NAD (n=4632) and MDD-AD (n=1063) and reported physician-confirmed specific cardiovascular diagnoses in the previous year. Results Compared to individuals without depression, those with MDD had a 50% increased odds of any cardiovascular diagnosis (P<.0001) independent of sociodemographic factors. Adjusting for sociodemographic differences in MDD subgroups, MDD-AD (compared to MDD-NAD) was associated with 60% (P<.0001) and 43% (P<.005) increases in the odds of hypertension and any cardiovascular diagnosis, respectively. These latter associations were no longer significant after adjusting for body mass index and substance use. Conclusion Individuals with major depression are at increased risk of heart disease.

241,0,"Exploring age of onset as a causal link between major depression and nonmedical use of prescription medications Background Nonmedical use of prescription medications (NUPM) has been associated with major depression (MDD), but the specific processes by which they might interact and influence one another are understudied. This investigation attempted to clarify the relationship between MDD and NUPM by examining whether age of MDD onset influenced current and past NUPM and by examining whether age of NUPM onset influenced lifetime or past year MDD. Methods These goals were met through use of data from the 2005 to 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Analyses utilized design-based logistic regression, and current age and order of MDD onset and NUPM initiation were examined in interactions with age of MDD or NUPM onset. Results For each year MDD onset was delayed, odds of lifetime, past year, past 30-day NUPM and substance dependence from NUPM were decreased by 2.3%, 2.6%, 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Earlier NUPM onset increased odds of past year (3.8%) and lifetime MDD (4.3%) in young adults, and lifetime MDD (2.5%) in 26--34 age group. Current age also interacted with age of MDD onset, with effects on NUPM pronounced in the 65 and older cohort. Order of MDD/NUPM onset generally did not interact with age of MDD onset, but it did interact with age of NUPM onset; the effects of NUPM onset on past year MDD were only significant in those with NUPM first. Conclusions These results highlight the need for further investigations of the interactions between depression and NUPM, particularly to evaluate potential causal relationships.

In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the dynamics of their everyday mood have been associated with various aspects of their lives. To some degree similar studies have been conducted in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In this paper we present the results of a systematic review of all ESM/EMA studies in MDD and BD to date. We focus not only on the correlates of patients' everyday mood but also on the impact on treatment, residual symptoms in remitted patients, on findings in pediatric populations, on MDD/BD specificity, and on links with neuroscience.

243,0,"Prevalence, Awareness, Treatment, and Burden of Major Depressive Disorder: Estimates from the National Health and Wellness Survey in Brazil Objective Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often underdiagnosed, undertreated, and associated with negative health outcomes. The current study examined the prevalence of MDD signs and symptoms in Brazil, including awareness, diagnosis, treatment, and the association of MDD with health outcomes. Methods Data were collected from the 2011 National Health and Wellness Survey in Brazil (N = 12,000). Excluding those with bipolar disorder, respondents who met Patient Health Questionnaire-9 criteria for MDD (n = 1105) were compared with those not qualifying as having MDD or any depressive symptoms (n = 8684), analyzing separately those currently taking (n = 184) or not taking (n = 155) prescription medication for depression. Sociodemographics and health status, symptoms, experience of depression, diagnosis, MDD severity, pharmacotherapy, productivity impairment (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire), health status (Short-Form 12, version 2), and health care resource use were measured. Results were weighted and projected to the Brazil adult population. Differences were measured with column proportion and mean tests for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively. Results MDD prevalence was 10.2%, with only 28.1% of the individuals with MDD diagnosed and 15.6% currently using prescription medication for depression. Males were especially likely to be unaware of MDD. Compared with non-MDD controls, patients with MDD (treated or untreated) reported significantly greater overall work impairment, worse mental and physical health status, and greater health care resource utilization (all P<0.05). There was a trend for worsening health outcomes with increasing MDD severity. Conclusions These findings suggest that Brazilians may be underdiagnosed and undertreated for MDD. Individuals with MDD reported substantially poorer health outcomes, suggesting the need to increase MDD awareness, especially among males, and provide better access to treatment.

We therefore systematically reviewed whether in vivo concentrations of glutamate, glutamine and Glx measured with 1H-MRS differ between MDD patients and controls. Meta-analysis including meta-regression, sensitivity, statistical heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses were conducted. Glutamate and Glx concentrations were found to be lower in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients compared to controls (standardized mean difference (SMD) for glutamate with 95% CIs: −0.86, −1.55 to −0.17; and for Glx: −1.15, −1.86 to −0.44). In addition, Glx was decreased in all brain regions together in current episode patients (SMD: −0.62, −1.17 to −0.07). We conclude that in MDD, glutamate and possibly glutamine are downregulated primarily in the ACC and during depressive states. These results fit the central role of the ACC in depressive symptomatology and suggest that in MDD changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission are state-dependent.

245,0,"Relations among posttraumatic stress disorder, comorbid major depression, and HPA function: A systematic review and meta-analysis Exposure to traumatic stress is associated with increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alterations of hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenocortical (HPA) function. Research linking traumatic stress with HPA function in PTSD has been inconsistent, however, in part due to (a) the inclusion of trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD (TE) in control groups and (b) a failure to consider comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and moderating variables. This meta-analysis of 47 studies (123 effect sizes, N=6008 individuals) revealed that daily cortisol output was lower for PTSD (d=−.36, SE=.15, p=.008) and PTSD+MDD (d=−.65, SE=.25, p=.008) groups relative to no trauma controls (NTC); TE and NTC groups did not differ significantly from each other. Afternoon/evening cortisol was lower in TE (d=−.25, SE=.09, p=.007) and PTSD (d=−.27, SE=.12, p=.021) groups and higher in PTSD+MDD groups (d=.49, SE=.24, p=.041) relative to NTC. Post-DST cortisol levels were lower in PTSD (d=−.40, SE=.12, p<.001), PTSD+MDD (d=−.65, SE=.14, p<.001), and TE groups (d=−.53, SE=.14, p<.001) relative to NTC. HPA effect sizes were moderated by age, sex, time since index event, and developmental timing of trauma exposure. These findings suggest that enhanced HPA feedback function may be a marker of trauma-exposure rather than a specific mechanism of vulnerability for PTSD, whereas lower daily cortisol output may be associated with PTSD in particular.

246,0,"Utility of self-reported sleep disturbances as a marker for major depressive disorder (MDD): Findings from the World Mental Health Japan Survey 2002--2006 Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious common disease, many depressive patients seek primary care with complaints of sleep disturbances that remain undiagnosed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of self-reported sleep disturbances as a marker for MDD. This study investigated the association between 12-month prevalence of self-reported sleep disturbances and MDD using data from a cross-sectional survey in Japan. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of self-reported sleep disturbances as a marker for MDD were 58.9%, 73.4%, 6.9%, 98.1%, and 0.66, respectively. Self-reported sleep disturbances showed highest utility for the youngest group. Among four types of sleep disturbances, the problem of daytime sleepiness was most useful as a marker for MDD. Combined with at least moderate role impairment, self-reported sleep disturbances became more informative with higher specificity (99.6%) and PPV (80.0%) as a marker for MDD.

Method Seven years of cross-sectional data (2004--2010) were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health to derive a nationally representative sample of 2,111 adolescents who had both a past-year MDE and SUD and whose insurance status was known. The associations of public and private insurance with MDE and SUD treatment were examined using multinomial logistic regressions that controlled for health status and sociodemographic variables. Results Less than one-half (48%) of adolescents received any form of MDE treatment in the past year, and only 10% received any form of SUD treatment. Only 16% of adolescents who received MDE treatment also received SUD treatment. Relative to no insurance, public insurance was associated with an increased likelihood of receiving MDE treatment alone, but not with an increased likelihood of receiving both MDE and SUD treatment. Involvement in the criminal justice system was the major factor affecting the likelihood that an adolescent would receive both MDE and SUD treatment, as opposed to either no treatment or treatment for MDE alone. Conclusions Exceptionally low rates of SUD treatment were observed in this high-risk sample.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on randomised controlled trials on HF and LF rTMS applied to the left and right DLPFC, respectively, for the treatment of MDD. Eight randomised controlled trials composed of 249 patients were selected to compare the effects of LF (≤1Hz) rTMS over the right DLPFC to HF (10--20Hz) rTMS over the left DLPFC. The therapeutic effects of both approaches were similar (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15; 95% confidence interval = 0.65--2.03). Dropout analysis based on only two studies was insufficient to draw a conclusion on the tolerability of LF rTMS. The pooled examination demonstrated that both rTMS methods were equally effective therapies for MDD. However, considering that LF right-sided rTMS produces fewer side effects and is more protective against seizures, its clinical applicability shows greater promise and should be explored further.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of pregnant teenagers enrolled in the national public health system in the urban area of Pelotas, southern Brazil. MDD was assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Abuse Assessment Screen was used to identify physical abuse within the last 12 months and during pregnancy, and social support was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Survey Social Support Scale. Results Forty-three (4.94%) potential subjects refused to participate, resulting in 828 total participants. The prevalence of MDD was 17.8%, 9.2% reported they had been subjected to violence within the last 12 months, while 5.8% had suffered violence during pregnancy, and the mean (SD) overall social support score was 87.40 (11.75). After adjustment, we found the highest incidence of MDD in adolescents with less than 8 years of education, followed by those with previous episodes of MDD and those with lower overall social support.

251,0,"Neural correlates of dysfunctional emotion regulation in major depressive disorder. A systematic review of neuroimaging studies Abnormal emotion processing is a core feature of major depressive disorder (MDD). Since the emergence of functional neuroimaging techniques, many studies have been conducted in MDD subjects to elucidate the underlying abnormalities in the neural systems involved in emotion regulation. In this systematic review, we discuss this research in the context of the neural model of emotion regulation previously described by Phillips et al. (2008). This model differentiates between automatic and voluntary emotion regulation subprocesses. Automatic regulation subprocesses were shown to involve predominantly medial prefrontal cortical structures, in addition to the hippocampus and parahippocampus, while voluntary regulation processes additionally recruited lateral prefrontal cortical regions. In conclusion, although the available data is limited, findings suggest that MDD subjects demonstrate abnormally reduced activity in lateral prefrontal cortices during explicit voluntary control of emotional experience. During early, automatic stages of emotion regulation, on the other hand, MDD subjects appear to achieve successful emotion regulation by recruiting additional lateral prefrontal neural regions, that may be mediated by medial prefrontal, especially rostral/dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) functioning. Dysfunctional automatic regulation may impair successful voluntary emotion regulation, and may present a target for novel therapeutic approaches in MDD.

Although a relationship between QOL and neurocognitive dysfunction has been reported during depressive episodes, little is known about this relationship in remitted MDD patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between QOL and neurocognitive dysfunction in patients with remitted MDD while controlling for confounding factors. Forty-three remitted MDD patients were assessed with neuropsychological tests and QOL, which was measured by a short-form 36-item health survey. The neurocognitive performances of the patients were compared with those of 43 healthy controls. We next evaluated the relationships between neurocognitive impairments, clinical factors, and QOL. Remitted MDD patients had poorer neurocognitive performances than healthy controls for psychomotor speed, attention, and verbal memory. Residual depressive symptoms were strongly associated with QOL. Delayed verbal recall was associated with general health perceptions, which are part of the QOL assessment, even after the effects of the residual depressive symptoms were considered.

This study examined and compared the prevalence and correlates of lifetime major depressive episode plus subthreshold hypomania D(m) with pure MDD, bipolar II disorder, and bipolar I disorder. Method Data were drawn from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a large cross-sectional survey (n=43,093) representative of the U.S. population. Results The lifetime prevalences were 2.53% for D(m), 1.12% for bipolar II disorder, 2.19% for bipolar I disorder and 10.70% for pure MDD. All bipolar disorders (i.e., D(m), BP-II, and BP-I) were half as frequent as MDD. Lifetime and 12-month psychiatric comorbidity, course and clinical characteristics, symptoms, health status and treatment-seeking rates were significantly different in participants with lifetime D(m) when compared to participants with pure MDD, but not when compared to participants with bipolar II disorder. Limitations Subthreshold hypomania diagnostic was based on the lifetime presence of at least one of the three screening questions for criterion A for hypomania, without a lifetime history of manic or hypomanic episode. This narrow definition, both in terms of the choice of hypomanic symptoms and their duration, could have led to an underestimation of the proportion of participants with a lifetime history of D(m). In addition, the cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow causal associations to be drawn. Conclusions Our data confirm and extend evidence of the clinical significance and validity of a subthreshold bipolarity-specifier applied to individuals with DSM-IV MDD.

In adults, subthreshold depression (SD) is viewed as being on a continuum with major depressive disorder (MDD). Whether this holds for children and adolescents, is still unclear. We performed the first systematic review of SD in subjects below 18 years, in order to explore if childhood SD and MDD share causal pathways, phenomenology and outcomes, supporting a dimensional view. Methods A critical systematic review in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. A review protocol was developed a priori, and all reports were assessed by two reviewers. Results The literature search generated 941 eligible references and 24 studies were included. Although diagnostic criteria for SD showed great variability, similarities for SD and MDD were striking. Both were common conditions with similar risk factor patterns. Clinical characteristics in both groups were depressed mood, suicidal ideation and high comorbidity. Outcomes were almost equally poor, with increased psychiatric morbidity and health service use. SD intervention studies showed promising results. Limitations Reports with data on SD not reported in keywords or abstract may have been missed by the search strategy. Conclusion A dimensional view of depressive disorders is also supported in children and adolescents, suggesting SD to be a precursor to MDD.

255,0,"Supporting the verification of compliance to safety standards via model-driven engineering: Approach, tool-support and empirical validation Context Many safety--critical systems are subject to safety certification as a way to provide assurance that these systems cannot unduly harm people, property or the environment. Creating the requisite evidence for certification can be a challenging task due to the sheer size of the textual standards based on which certification is performed and the amenability of these standards to subjective interpretation. Objective This paper proposes a novel approach to aid suppliers in creating the evidence necessary for certification according to standards. The approach is based on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and addresses the challenges of using certification standards while providing assistance with compliance. Method Given a safety standard, a conceptual model is built that provides a succinct and explicit interpretation of the standard. This model is then used to create a UML profile that helps system suppliers in relating the concepts of the safety standard to those of the application domain, in turn enabling the suppliers to demonstrate how their system development artifacts comply with the standard. Results We provide a generalizable and tool-supported solution to support the verification of compliance to safety standards. Empirical validation of the work is presented via an industrial case study that shows how the concepts of a sub-sea production control system can be aligned with the evidence requirements of the IEC61508 standard. A subsequent survey examines the perceptions of practitioners about the solution. Conclusion The case study indicates that the supplier company where the study was performed found the approach useful in helping them prepare for certification of their software. The survey indicates that practitioners found our approach easy to understand and that they would be willing to adopt it in practice.

256,0,"The bidirectional relationships between alcohol, cannabis, co-occurring alcohol and cannabis use disorders with major depressive disorder: Results from a national sample Introduction Alcohol use disorders (AUD) and cannabis use disorders (CUD) are common in the United States (US), and are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Co-occurring alcohol and cannabis use/use disorders (AUD+CUD), though understudied, have been found to be associated with greater adverse outcomes than alcohol or cannabis use/use disorders alone. There is a paucity of research on the co-occurring relationships of the two disorders with depression. Methods Data came from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a population-based longitudinal survey of the adult non-institutionalized, civilian population in the US. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between: 1) baseline AUD, CUD, and co-occurring AUD+CUD with incident MDD at follow-up and 2) baseline MDD with incident AUD, CUD, and co-occurring AUD+CUD at follow-up, adjusted for potential confounding variables. Results For Aim 1, most of the AUD and CUD were positively associated with MDD. The strongest associations with incident MDD were observed for cannabis dependence (OR=6.61, CI=1.67--26.21) and co-occurring alcohol and cannabis dependence (OR=2.34, CI=1.23--4.48). For Aim 2, baseline MDD was significantly associated with comparatively fewer cases of incident AUD and CUD but the strongest association was observed for new onset co-occurring alcohol and cannabis dependence (OR=4.51, CI=1.31--15.60).

257,0,"The role of family history in mental health service utilization for major depression Background The purpose of the study was to examine the association between family history of major depressive disorder (MDD) and mental health service utilization for MDD. Methods Data come from wave 1 (2001--2002) and wave 2 (2004--2005) of the US National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The AUDADIS was used to determine the presence of lifetime and incident MDD. Participants with a mother, father, grandparent or sibling with MDD were considered to have a positive family history. Mental health service utilization among participants with lifetime MDD was studied. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, education, marital status, family income) and disease severity. Results Approximately 7940 NESARC participants had lifetime MDD, 54.7% of them had family history of the disorder. Compared to participants with no family history of MDD, those with such family history were two times more likely to access treatment (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 2.11--2.68). Parental, and particularly maternal history of MDD, was most strongly associated with MDD treatment. Limitations Data were unavailable on the timing of family history of MDD and its possible under-report, and differences between participants with treated vs untreated relatives. Institutionalized individuals were not included. Conclusions Individuals with parental and maternal history of major depression were two times more likely to receive treatment for MDD than those with no such history. Efforts to increase access to healthcare for those who do not report family history of MDD could prove effective in addressing existing unmet treatment needs.

258,0,"Why does the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder in the elderly appear to be lower than in younger adults? Results from a national representative sample Background The explanation of the lower lifetime prevalence rate of major depressive disorder (MDD) in older adults compared to younger people in community surveys is debated. This study examines the hypothesis that the decrease of the lifetime prevalence of MDD in older adults may be due to an age-related difference in the lifetime prevalence of subthreshold hypomania and, to a lesser extent, to the increased rate of medical induced-depression. Methods Data were derived from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a national representative sample of 43,093 adults of the United States population. We examined lifetime prevalence rates of pure MDD and MDD plus subthreshold hypomania (D(m)) by age, assuming that the lifetime prevalence of pure MDD in older adults would be similar to that in the youngest cohort, consequent to an inverse age-D(m) relationship. We further considered non-hierarchical MDD (i.e., general medical condition depressive disorders were not ruled out) with the same method. Results The lifetime prevalence of D(m) among depressed adults aged 65 years and over was substantially lower compared to the youngest group. When considering non-hierarchical MDD, the odds ratio of the lifetime prevalence estimates of non-hierarchical pure MDD in older adults compared to the youngest group appeared not significantly different from 1.

The risk for MDD in FDR of BD probands and vice versa is also investigated. Methods A systematic review of case-control and cohort studies, which were published between 1977 and 2012; reported relative risks (RR) or odd ratios (OR) or equivalent raw data; made an explicit distinction between MDD and BD; used operational diagnostic criteria; and reported systematic proband recruitment and ascertainment of relatives. Studies were obtained by electronic MEDLINE and EMBASE searches and hand-searching. Estimates were derived from pooled data using random effects methods. Results Of an initial sample of 241 articles, 22 were eligible for inclusion. For FDRs of one proband with MDD compared to healthy control probands, estimates for MDD were OR=2.14 (95% CI 1.72--2.67), increasing to OR=3.23 (95% CI 2.11--4.94) for two MDD probands. For FDRs of one BD proband compared to healthy control probands, estimates for BD were OR=7.92 (95% CI 2.45--25.61), and OR=6.58 (95% CI 2.64--16.43) for FDRs of two BD probands.

260,0,"Adipokines as emerging depression biomarkers: A systematic review and meta-analysis Adiponectin, leptin and resistin may play a role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, differences in peripheral levels of these hormones are inconsistent across diagnostic and intervention studies. Therefore, we performed meta-analyses of diagnostic studies (i.e., MDD subjects versus healthy controls) and intervention investigations (i.e., pre-vs. post-antidepressant treatment) in MDD. Adiponectin (N = 1278; Hedge's g = −0.35; P = 0.16) and leptin (N = 893; Hedge's g = −0.018; P = 0.93) did not differ across diagnostic studies. Meta-regression analyses revealed that gender and depression severity explained the heterogeneity observed in adiponectin diagnostic studies, while BMI and the difference in BMI between MDD individuals and controls explained the heterogeneity of leptin diagnostic studies. Subgroup analyses revealed that adiponectin peripheral levels were significantly lower in MDD participants compared to controls when assayed with RIA, but not ELISA. Leptin levels were significantly higher in individuals with mild/moderate depression versus controls. Resistin serum levels were lower in MDD individuals compared to healthy controls (N = 298; Hedge's g = −0.25; P = 0.03). Leptin serum levels did not change after antidepressant treatment. However, heterogeneity was significant and sample size was low (N = 108); consequently meta-regression analysis could not be performed. Intervention meta-analyses could not be performed for adiponectin and resistin (i.e., few studies met inclusion criteria). In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis underscored that relevant moderators/confounders (e.g., BMI, depression severity and type of assay) should be controlled for when considering the role of leptin and adiponectin as putative MDD diagnostic biomarkers.

Methods Drawing data for 39,133 non-institutionalized adults from the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we assessed marijuana use status, frequent use, dependence or abuse, and quit behaviors in association with lifetime clinician-identified depression, lifetime and recent major depressive episode (MDE), and recent SPD. Results Adults with depression or SPD were at a significantly higher risk of being lifetime ever users (OR=1.60--2.08), past year users (OR=1.67--1.86), frequent users (OR=1.40--1.62), and dependent or abusing users (OR=2.32--3.05) compared with adults without these symptoms. Adults with depression or SPD had a lower quit ratio overall, but were equally or even more likely to make quit or self-regulation attempts. Further analysis suggested that adults with recent MDE had the greatest level of quit attempts or self-regulation attempts compared with adults without MDE or with past MDE.

Methods Data were drawn from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a large cross-sectional survey (N = 43,093) representative of the US population. Results Compared with participants aged 65 years and older without a 12-month diagnosis of MDD, those with MDD were more likely to have lifetime and 12-month comorbid psychiatric disorders. Except for lifetime dysthymia, we found no significant interaction between rates of current somatic comorbidity, lifetime and 12-month psychiatric comorbidity, and age groups. Compared with younger participants with a 12-month MDD, they had an older age at onset, reported a similar number of lifetime major depressive episodes and perceived health status, and had lower mental health service utilization rates. Conclusions Current major depression in the elderly seems to be as disabling as in younger adults in terms of comorbid psychiatric disorders and impaired quality of life.

263,0,"Cross-country variation in the sociodemographic factors associated with major depressive episode in Norway, the United Kingdom, Ghana, and Kenya Studies based on Western samples generally show that status characteristics like gender or marital status are associated with better mental health for individuals who occupy advantageous positions, such as men or the married. However, these patterns may not hold in developing regions that differ in important ways from the West. Guided by the Stress Process Model (SPM), this study uses logistic regression to examine the effect of gender, education, and other status characteristics on major depressive episode (MDE). Similarities and differences in these associations across two Western and two African countries are also assessed. Nationally representative data for adults ages 18 years and older are from the World Health Surveys (2002--2004) for Norway (N = 943), the United Kingdom (UK: N = 1195), Ghana (N = 3922), and Kenya (N = 4331). Results indicate a mixed pattern of associations between status characteristics and MDE across the four countries. Norwegian men face higher risk of MDE than Norwegian women---an anomalous finding. With some exceptions, education and employment status are not significantly related to MDE across the countries, providing little support for SPM. Marital status differences in risk of MDE are largest for Norway and smallest for Ghana. For the UK, men face lower risk of MDE than women across levels of mastery, and the gender gap in MDE is larger at higher levels of mastery. Overall, there is some heterogeneity in the associations between status characteristics and MDE even in somewhat similar environments like Ghana and Kenya. This study extends the reach of SPM to settings in sub-Saharan Africa, and contributes to the sparse empirical literature on the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of MDE in the general populations of Ghana and Kenya.

Using data from the National Survey on American Life, the present study determined the association between an arrest history and major depressive disorder (MDD), while accounting for discrimination among African Americans, US-born Afro-Caribbeans and first-generation Black immigrants. Findings from logistic regression analyses adjusted for discrimination suggested an arrest history is associated with 12-month MDD (Adjusted OR=1.47; 95% CI=1.02--2.10) and lifetime MDD (Adjusted OR=1.56 CI=1.17--2.09). Accounting for drug and alcohol dependence attenuated the association between arrest history and 12-month MDD, but not lifetime MDD. The associations between arrest history and both 12-month and lifetime MDD, and discrimination and lifetime MDD varied by ethnic/immigrant group. Specifically, while the association between arrest history and MDD (both 12-month and lifetime) was strongest among US-born Afro-Caribbeans, evidence consistent with the immigrant paradox, the association between discrimination and lifetime MDD was particularly relevant for first-generation Black immigrants, suggesting discrimination may hinder the protection of first-generation status.

265,0,"DSM-IV diagnosis in depressed primary care patients with previous psychiatric ICD-10 bipolar disorder Background In the past 20 years, much evidence has accumulated against the overly restrictive diagnostic concepts of hypomania in DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR. We tested DSM-IV-TR and a broader modified version (DSM-IV-TRm) for their ability to detect bipolarity in patients who had been treated for bipolar disorders (BD) in psychiatric settings, and who now consulted general practitioners (GPs) for new major depressive episodes (MDE). Methods Bipolact II was an observational, single-visit survey involving 390 adult patients attending primary care for MDE (DSM-IV-TR criteria) in 201 GP offices in France. The participating GPs (53.3$\pm$6.5 years old, 80.1% male) were trained by the Bipolact Educational Program, and were familiar with the medical care of depressive patients. Results Of the 390 patients with MDE, 129 (33.1%) were previously known as bipolar patients (ICD-10 criteria). Most of the latter bipolar patients (89.7%) had previously been treated with antidepressants. Only 9.3% of them met DMS-IV-TR criteria for BD. Conversely, 79.1% of the 129 bipolar patients met DMS-IV-TRm criteria for BD and showed strong associations with impulse control disorders and manic/hypomanic switches during antidepressant treatment. Limitations Limited training of participating GPs, recall bias of patients, and the study not being representative for untreated bipolar patients.

In light of specific limitations of existing reviews, we assess if antidepressants are efficacious and tolerable for sub-threshold or mild major depressive disorder (MDD). Method Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of adults with sub-threshold depression or mild MDD (initial baseline symptom severity of HRSD≤20) comparing an antidepressant with placebo or treatment as usual (TAU) however defined. A pre-specified protocol was published (Prospero reference: CRD42013004505). Results 8 trials were included: 5 trials (453 participants) of sub-threshold depression and 3 trials (502 participants) of mild MDD. Trials of sub-threshold depression exhibited low risk of bias whereas those of mild MDD exhibited high risk. Two trials of sub-threshold depression were pooled (n=102) to assess efficacy and favoured antidepressants over placebo statistically but the difference was small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful: mean difference −1.39 (−2.41, −0.36). Due to heterogeneity, no trials of mild MDD could be pooled for efficacy. There was no difference between antidepressant treatment and placebo for drop out due to adverse events. The maximum proportion in those receiving antidepressants dropping out due to adverse events was 17%, with indication of a dose effect. Limitations Not all data from identified trials could be included in the meta-analyses due to a lack of availability of relevant data. Conclusion There is insufficient evidence to support or contest the efficacy of antidepressant medication for sub-threshold depression or mild MDD.

267,0,"Functional brain imaging studies of youth depression: A systematic review Background There is growing interest in understanding the neurobiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) in youth, particularly in the context of neuroimaging studies. This systematic review provides a timely comprehensive account of the available functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature in youth MDD. Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMED, PsycINFO and Science Direct databases, to identify fMRI studies in younger and older youth with MDD, spanning 13--18 and 19--25years of age, respectively. Results Twenty-eight studies focusing on 5 functional imaging domains were identified, namely emotion processing, cognitive control, affective cognition, reward processing and resting-state functional connectivity. Elevated activity in ``extended medial network'' regions including the anterior cingulate, ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as the amygdala was most consistently implicated across these five domains. For the most part, findings in younger adolescents did not differ from those in older youth; however a general comparison of findings in both groups compared to adults indicated differences in the domains of cognitive control and affective cognition. Conclusions Youth MDD is characterized by abnormal activations in ventromedial frontal regions, the anterior cingulate and amygdala, which are broadly consistent with the implicated role of medial network regions in the pathophysiology of depression. Future longitudinal studies examining the effects of neurodevelopmental changes and pubertal maturation on brain systems implicated in youth MDD will provide a more comprehensive neurobiological model of youth depression.

268,0,"Inflammation in Children and Adolescents With Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review Objective There has been rapid growth in research regarding inflammation in neuropsychiatric disorders as it relates to youth. We therefore set out to systematically review the literature on inflammation and neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Method A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Studies were included if proinflammatory markers (PIMs) in children and/or adolescents with neuropsychiatric disorders were measured. Results Sixty-seven studies were included, involving 3,952 youth. Evidence for a proinflammatory state is strongest for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). PIMs are elevated in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette's disorder (TD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia (SZ). However, the data are inconsistent. Evidence for specific PIMs is equivocal at this stage, although the findings in youth with MDD, BD, and PTSD converge with the extant adult literature in these areas. Definitive conclusions are limited by methodologic factors including cross-sectional and retrospective study design, between-study differences in specific markers and methods of analysis, small sample size, and other sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion The literature regarding inflammation among children and adolescents with neuropsychiatric disorders represents nearly 4,000 youth. There is preliminary evidence for elevated markers of inflammation in this population. Larger, prospective studies are needed to realize the goal of inflammatory markers informing clinical practice.

Methods Data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) were extracted for secondary data analyses on the rates of major depression disorder (MDD) and major depressive episode (MDE) in the two groups. Results Findings showed that for life time MDD, the rates for China-to-US immigrant and US-born Chinese were 5.3% and 7.9% for men and 8.5% and 33.1% for women. For 12-month MDD, the corresponding rates were 2.2% and 3.4% for men, and 4.7% and 12.6% for women. For life time MDE, the corresponding rates were 6.8% and 8.8% for men; for women the rates were 8.5% and 33.1%. For 12-month MDE, the rates were 2.2% and 4.4% for men; the rates were 4.7% and 12.6% for women. Controlling for age, education level, income, BMI, marital status, and income-to-needs ratio, China-to-US immigrant women remained less likely to have life time major depression than US-born Chinese American women.

270,0,"Major depressive disorder in breast cancer: A critical systematic review of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic clinical trials Background While women with breast cancer often face varying levels of psychological distress, there is a subgroup whose symptomatology reaches a threshold for diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Major depressive disorder is known to influence patient outcomes, such as health-related quality of life and treatment adherence. There are no systematic reviews that evaluate pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment trials for MDD among individuals with breast cancer. Methods Two authors independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and Clinical Trials.gov databases through February 20, 2013 without language restrictions. Core journals, reference lists and citation tracking were also searched. Articles on breast cancer patients were included if they (1) included participants with a diagnosis of MDD; (2) investigated pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatments for MDD compared to placebo or usual care in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Results Two RCTs on antidepressant treatment met inclusion criteria. However, no RCTs investigating the effects of psychological treatments for MDD in breast cancer were identified. Notwithstanding the paucity of data investigating the effects of psychological treatments for MDD in breast cancer, numerous psychotherapeutic strategies targeting depressive symptoms were identified. Mianserin had significant antidepressant effects when compared to placebo in a 6-week, parallel-group, RCT of Stage I--II breast cancer in women with MDD. Desipramine and paroxetine were reported to be no more efficacious than placebo in a 6-week, RCT of Stage I--IV breast cancer in women with MDD. Conclusions The evidence reviewed herein underscores the paucity of data available to guide clinicians in treatment decisions for MDD in individuals with breast cancer. Therefore, the treatment of MDD in breast cancer is primarily based on clinical experience.

271,0,"Model-driven engineering practices in industry: Social, organizational and managerial factors that lead to success or failure In this article, we attempt to address the relative absence of empirical studies of model driven engineering (MDE) in two different but complementary ways. First, we present an analysis of a large online survey of MDE deployment and experience that provides some rough quantitative measures of MDE practices in industry. Second, we supplement these figures with qualitative data obtained from some semi-structured, in-depth interviews with MDE practitioners, and, in particular, through describing the practices of four commercial organizations as they adopted a model driven engineering approach to their software development practices. Using in-depth semi-structured interviewing, we invited practitioners to reflect on their experiences and selected four to use as exemplars or case studies. In documenting some details of their attempts to deploy model driven practices, we identify a number of factors, in particular the importance of complex organizational, managerial and social factors--as opposed to simple technical factors--that appear to influence the relative success, or failure, of the endeavor. Three of the case study companies describe genuine success in their use of model driven development, but explain that as examples of organizational change management, the successful deployment of model driven engineering appears to require: a progressive and iterative approach; transparent organizational commitment and motivation; integration with existing organizational processes and a clear business focus.

272,0,"On the use of software design models in software development practice: An empirical investigation Research into software design models in general, and into the UML in particular, focuses on answering the question how design models are used, completely ignoring the question if they are used. There is an assumption in the literature that the UML is the de facto standard, and that use of design models has had a profound and substantial effect on how software is designed by virtue of models giving the ability to do model-checking, code generation, or automated test generation. However for this assumption to be true, there has to be significant use of design models in practice by developers. This paper presents the results of a survey summarizing the answers of 3785 developers answering the simple question on the extent to which design models are used before coding. We relate their use of models with (i) total years of programming experience, (ii) open or closed development, (iii) educational level, (iv) programming language used, and (v) development type. The answer to our question was that design models are not used very extensively in industry, and where they are used, the use is informal and without tool support, and the notation is often not UML. The use of models decreased with an increase in experience and increased with higher level of qualification. Overall we found that models are used primarily as a communication and collaboration mechanism where there is a need to solve problems and/or get a joint understanding of the overall design in a group. We also conclude that models are seldom updated after initially created and are usually drawn on a whiteboard or on paper.

273,0,"Racial/Ethnic Differences in Perceived Reasons for Mental Health Treatment in US Adolescents With Major Depression Objective Racial/ethnic differences in the course of treatment for a major depressive episode (MDE) among adolescents may arise, in part, from variation in the perceived rationale for treatment. We examined racial/ethnic differences in the perceived reasons for receiving mental health (MH) treatment among adolescents with an MDE. Method A total of 2,789 adolescent participants who experienced an MDE and received MH treatment in the past year were drawn from the 2005 to 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Adolescents reported the settings in which they received care and reasons for their most recent visit to each setting. Distributions of specific depressive symptoms were compared across racial/ethnic groups. Racial/ethnic differences in endorsing each of 11 possible reasons for receiving treatment were examined using weighted probit regressions adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, health and mental health status, treatment setting, and survey year. Results Despite similar depressive symptom profiles, Hispanic adolescents were more likely than whites to endorse ``breaking rules'' or getting into physical fights as reasons for MH treatment. Black adolescents were more likely than white adolescents to endorse ``problems at school'' but less likely to endorse ``felt very afraid or tense'' or ``eating problems'' as reasons for treatment. Asian adolescents were more likely to endorse ``problems with people other than friends or family'' but less likely than whites to endorse ``suicidal thoughts/attempt'' and ``felt depressed'' as reasons for treatment. Conclusion Racial/ethnic minority participants were more likely than white participants to endorse externalizing or interpersonal problems and less likely to endorse internalizing problems as reasons for MH treatment.

274,0,"Systematic review of appropriate cognitive assessment instruments used in clinical trials of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder Cognitive dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a symptom in mental conditions including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BPD). Despite the many available cognitive assessment instruments, consensus is lacking on their appropriate use in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic literature review in Embase, PubMed/Medline and PsychINFO to identify appropriate cognitive function instruments for use in clinical trials of schizophrenia, MDD, and BPD. Instruments were identified from the articles. Instruments and articles were excluded if they did not address schizophrenia, MDD, or BPD. Instrument appropriateness was further assessed by the criteria of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative: test--retest reliability, utility, relationship to functional status, potential changeability to pharmacological agents, and tolerability and practicality for clinical trials. The database search yielded 173 articles describing 150 instruments used to assess cognitive function. Seventeen additional instruments were identified through Google and clinicaltrials.gov.

Methods A literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to ascertain if polysomnographic abnormalities (REM density, REM latency, sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep) warrant additional effort to develop them into a clinical diagnostic test for major depressive disorder (MDD). The 31 publications meeting inclusion criteria were then classified into one of three progressive steps using guidelines for evaluating the clinical usefulness of a diagnostic test. Results Most of the abnormalities found in MDD patients, when compared to healthy controls, occurred in the expected direction with moderate effect sizes but with substantial publication bias and heterogeneity. Eleven studies compared abnormalities in MDD to other psychiatric disorders (step 2a), and four studies provided data on the sensitivity or specificity of the findings in differentiating among the psychiatric disorders that frequently appear on the same differential diagnostic list as MDD (step 2b). No multicenter trial has been conducted prospectively to test the clinical utility of the diagnostic test (step 3). Limitations Only published articles in the English language were used.

We also examined the association between their psychopathology and characteristics of pain according to a face-to-face survey by an experienced psychiatrist and psychologist. We analyzed 233 HCs, 94 MDD patients, and 75 SZ patients using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and SF-8 (all participants), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 items (MDD patients), and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (SZ patients). Although MDD patients experienced more pain than HCs, there was no difference in the prevalence of pain between SZ patients and HCs. Moreover, HCs with pain did not have higher SF-8 total scores than those without pain, whereas both MDD and SZ patients with pain had higher SF-8 total scores than those without pain. The severity of psychopathology in MDD and SZ patients was also positively associated with both the prevalence of pain and MPQ scores. MPQ scores were also associated with positive symptoms in SZ patients. Considering these results, physicians need to query MDD patients about physical pain during examination if they are to ensure a favorable and quick response to treatment.

Despite the empirical support for the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), the specific mechanisms by which MBCT leads to therapeutic change remain unclear. Objective By means of a systematic review we evaluate how the field is progressing in its empirical investigation of mechanisms of change in MBCT for recurrent MDD. Method To identify relevant studies, a systematic search was conducted. Studies were coded and ranked for quality. Results The search produced 476 articles, of which 23 were included. In line with the theoretical premise, 12 studies found that alterations in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness were associated with, predicted or mediated MBCT's effect on treatment outcome. In addition, preliminary studies indicated that alterations in attention, memory specificity, self-discrepancy, emotional reactivity and momentary positive and negative affect might play a role in how MBCT exerts its clinical effects. Conclusion The results suggest that MBCT could work through some of the MBCT model's theoretically predicted mechanisms.

Methods A search for papers published in English was conducted using PubMed with the following words: depression, treatment, resting-state, connectivity, and fMRI. Findings from 21 studies of relations between resting-state fMRI and treatment response in MDD are presented, and common findings and themes are discussed. Results The use of resting-state fMRI in research on MDD treatment response has yielded a number of consistent findings that provide a basis for understanding the potential mechanisms of action of antidepressant treatment response. These included (1) associations between response to antidepressant medications and increased functional connectivity between frontal and limbic brain regions, possibly resulting in greater inhibitory control over neural circuits that process emotions; (2) connectivity of visual recognition circuits in studies that compared treatment resistant and treatment sensitive patients; (3) response to TMS was consistently predicted by subcallosal cortex connectivity; and (4) hyperconnectivity of the default mode network and hypoconnectivity of the cognitive control network differentiated treatment-resistant from treatment-sensitive MDD patients. Limitations There was also considerable variability between studies with respect to study designs and analytic strategies that made direct comparisons across all studies difficult. Conclusions Continued standardization of study designs and analytic strategies as well as aggregation of larger datasets will allow the field to better elucidate the potential mechanisms of action of treatment response in patients with MDD to ultimately generate algorithms to predict which patients will respond to which antidepressant treatments.

Over a decade of research on MDS has resulted in a large number of publications. Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR ) is essential. Method: We conducted an extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary MDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified, strictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of our SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified primary MDS studies. For example, regarding security modelling artefact, we found that developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches. The current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the identified primary MDS studies into 5 significant MDS studies, and other emerging or less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains supporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the application of MDS methodologies.

This study examined associations between mental disorders and alcohol use/nonuse patterns among individuals aged 65+ years. Methods Data came from the public use files of the 2008 to 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Alcohol use/nonuse groups were lifetime abstainers, ex-drinkers, bingers, and nonbingers. Mental health problems were lifetime major depressive episode (MDE) and anxiety disorder, past-year MDE and anxiety disorder, and past-year serious suicidal ideation. To minimize selection biases resulting from a complex array of covariates, we implemented a generalized boosted model to generate propensity score weights on covariates. Then we employed logistic regression models with mental health outcomes as the dependent variables. Results The four alcohol use/nonuse groups did not differ in past-year MDE. However, odds ratios show that, relative to non-binge drinking, lifetime abstention decreased the odds of lifetime MDE by more than 60% (OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.23--0.68, p=.001) and the odds of lifetime anxiety disorder by almost half (OR=0.55, 95% CI=0.38--0.79, p=.002). Ex-drinkers were more likely than nonbingers to report past-year serious suicidal thoughts (OR=2.29, 95% CI=1.45--3.62, p<.001). Conclusions While lifetime abstainers had significantly better lifetime mental health histories than nonbingers, ex-drinkers had worse past-year mental health status.

The current paper aims to draw together and provide a critical overview of existing studies of AVHs in BD and MDD. Methods A systematic review was undertaken using the search terms 'hallucinations' or 'hearing voices' in conjunction with 'bipolar disorder', 'mania' or 'manic-depressive' or 'major depressive disorder' or 'depression' or 'affective disorder' or 'mood disorder'. After applying a pre-defined set of inclusion criteria, 14 eligible peer-reviewed publications were accepted for further analysis. Results Prevalence rates of AVHs in BD (11.3--62.8%) and MDD (5.4--40.6%) varied. When psychotic features were examined, persecutory and grandiose delusions were especially common in BD (though the latter did not necessarily occur in conjunction with AVHs). A single known neuroimaging study has suggested increased fronto-temporal connectivity relating to AVHs in BD. Limitations Methodological challenges relating to fluctuations in mood states and limited use of validated instruments, coupled with post-episode recall bias, pose as specific barriers to the collection of meaningful phenomenological information.

284,0,"Binge drinking and the risk of suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts Background Major depression is one of the strongest known risk factors for suicide. However, of the estimated 8.5 million adults with serious thoughts of suicide in the past year, only half had a major depressive episode (MDE). Identifying risk factors for suicide in the absence of depression may provide additional targets for prevention and intervention. This study uses nationally representative data to evaluate the association of binge drinking with suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts in adults with and without MDE. Methods Combined 2008--2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data were analyzed. Sex-stratified prevalence estimates of past year suicide indicators were generated by past month binge drinking and past year MDE status. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of binge drinking with suicide indicators by sex with and without MDE. Results Unadjusted prevalence estimates for suicide indicators in males and females were higher among binge drinkers than among nonbinge drinkers, regardless of MDE status. Regression analyses indicated that binge drinking was associated with suicidal thoughts (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.28--1.79), plans (aOR=1.75, CI=1.23--2.48), and attempts (aOR=2.57, CI=1.74--3.79) in females without MDE and with suicidal thoughts in males without MDE (aOR=1.25, CI=1.04--1.49).

Methods We used PubMed to search for cases of BND that were diagnosed before adolescence and added data from two of our cases. Results The analyzed cohort comprised 46 patients (28 boys and 18 girls; mean [SD] age, 12.5$\pm$13.3months; range, 20days to 4years). The mean time for spontaneous resolution was 2.8$\pm$2.4months (range, 1week to 8months) after onset of BND without any intervention. The diagnosis was mammary ductal ectasia (MDE) in 15 patients, gynecomastia with MDE in two patients, hemorrhagic cysts in two patients, and gynecomastia alone in one patient. The majority (89.3%) of patients 1year (50.0%) underwent surgery. Surgery was performed more often in patients in whom a mass had been identified. Conclusions Age and findings at physical examination affect selection of treatment, but not sex. We found no reported cases of malignancy.

A systematic review of cross-sectional studies examining differences in unipolar and bipolar depression Introduction While pediatric mania and depression can be distinguished from each other, differentiating between unipolar major depressive disorder (unipolar MDD) and bipolar major depression (bipolar MDD) poses unique clinical and therapeutic challenges. Our aim was to examine the current body of knowledge on whether unipolar MDD and bipolar MDD in youth could be distinguished from one another in terms of clinical features and correlates. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted on studies assessing the clinical characteristics and correlates of unipolar MDD and bipolar MDD in youth. Results Four scientific papers that met our priori inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified. These papers reported that bipolar MDD is distinct from unipolar MDD in its higher levels of depression severity, associated impairment, psychiatric co-morbidity with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder and anxiety disorders, and family history of mood and disruptive behavior disorders in first-degree relatives.

Methods The data came from the prospective national representative Santé et Itinéraire Professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to measure MDE and GAD. Analyses were performed using weighted generalized estimation equations, and were stratified by gender. Results No changes in MDE and GAD were observed for both genders among the working population. No differential changes were observed, except one: the prevalence of GAD increased among women working in the public sector while there was no change among women in the private sector. Limitations Two data collections over a 4-year period may not capture the effects of the crisis on mental disorders properly. Conclusion No changes in mental disorders between 2006 and 2010 were found but the increase in the prevalence of anxiety among women in the public sector may be of particular interest for prevention policies.

288,0,"Cigarette smoking and the onset and persistence of depression among adults in the United States: 1994--2005 Background The present study investigated the relationship between daily cigarette smoking and risk of onset and persistence of major depressive disorder (MDD) over a 10-year period among adults in the United States and whether successful smoking cessation reduced the risk for MDD. Method Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States Survey (MIDUS; n=2101) Waves I and II. Logistic regressions were used to investigate the relations between smoking and the onset and persistence of MDD, adjusting for demographic characteristics and substance use problems. Results Daily smoking in 1994 [OR=1.9 (1.2--3.2)] and persistent daily smoking (in 1994 and 2005) [OR=2.2 (1.3--3.7)] were both associated with a significantly increased likelihood of MDD in 2005. Additionally, abstinence, compared to daily smoking, for more than 10years significantly reduced the risk of MDD in 2005 [OR=0.5 (0.3--0.87)] and persistent MDD in 1994 and 2005; [OR=0.5 (0.3--0.87)]. Conclusions Findings from this study provide new insights into the role of smoking in the onset and persistence of MDD. Namely, among those in mid-adulthood, smoking is associated with greater MDD risk and quitting may help to reduce such risk. These results suggest that there may be merit in targeting smoking to reduce the risk of MDD and the mental health benefits of quitting smoking in the form of reduced risk of MDD could usefully be added to common information listed as reasons to quit.

289,0,"Clinical and sociodemographic correlates of severe insomnia in psychotropic drug-free, Asian outpatients with major depressive disorder Background Little has been known regarding the correlates of severe insomnia in major depressive disorder (MDD). This post-hoc analysis aimed to examine the sociodemographic and clinical correlates of severe insomnia in psychotropic drug-free, Asian adult outpatients with MDD. Methods Participants were psychotropic drug-free patients with MDD, aged 18--65 years. By using the Symptom Checklist-90 Items, Revised (SCL-90-R), a score of 4 (severe distress) on any one of three insomnia items was defined as severe insomnia. Other measures included the Montgomery--Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the nine psychopathology subscales of SCL-90-R, the Physical and Mental Component Summaries of Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 PCS and SF-36 MCS), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Results Of 528 participants, their mean age being 39.5 (SD=13.26) years, 64.2% were females, and 239 (45.3%) had severe insomnia. The logistic regression model revealed that low educational qualifications (less than secondary school completion), high SCL-90-R Depression scores, high SCL-90-R Anxiety scores, and low SF-36 PCS scores were independently correlated with severe insomnia (p's<.05). Limitations Insomnia was determined only by the patient's distress. Middle insomnia was not assessed. Psychotropic drug-free patients with MDD are not commonly seen in psychiatric practice. Conclusion Severe insomnia is common in patients with MDD. It is closely related with low educational qualification, subjective depression and anxiety severity, and poor physical health.

290,0,"Development of service-oriented architectures using model-driven development: A mapping study Context Model-Driven Development (MDD) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are two challenging research areas in software engineering. MDD is about improving software development whilst SOA is a service-based conceptual development style, therefore investigating the available proposals in the literature to use MDD when developing SOA may be insightful. However, no studies have been found with this purpose. Objective This work aims at assessing the state of the art in MDD for SOA systems. It mainly focuses on: what are the characteristics of MDD approaches that support SOA; what types of SOA are supported; how do they handle non-functional requirements. Method We conducted a mapping study following a rigorous protocol. We identified the representative set of venues that should be included in the study. We applied a search string over the set of selected venues. As result, 129 papers were selected and analysed (both frequency analysis and correlation analysis) with respect to the defined classification criteria derived from the research questions. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results The analysis allows us to answer the research questions. We highlight: (1) predominance of papers from Europe and written by researchers only; (2) predominance of top-down transformation in software development activities; (3) inexistence of consolidated methods; (4) significant percentage of works without tool support; (5) SOA systems and service compositions more targeted than single services and SOA enterprise systems; (6) limited use of metamodels; (7) very limited use of NFRs; and (8) limited application in real cases. Conclusion This mapping study does not just provide the state of the art in the topic, but also identifies several issues that deserve investigation in the future, for instance the need of methods for activities other than software development (e.g., migration) or the need of conducting more real case studies.

We used archival data from 283 previously war-zone deployed Canadian veterans. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to uncover patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity as measured via the PTSD Checklist-Military version (PCL-M) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Individual membership of latent classes was used in a series of one-way ANOVAs to ascertain group differences related to HRF as measured via the Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). LPA resulted in three discrete patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity which were characterized by high symptoms of PTSD and MDD, moderate symptoms, and low symptoms. All ANOVAs comparing class membership on the SF-36 subscales were statistically significant demonstrating group differences across levels of HRF. The group with the highest symptoms reported the worst HRF followed by the medium and low symptom groups.

Method Data are from the National Comorbidity Survey--Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a nationally representative survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years that assesses DSM-IV disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Version 3.0. One parent or surrogate of each participating adolescent was also asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire. Results Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of MDD were 11.0% and 7.5%, respectively. The corresponding rates of severe MDD were 3.0% and 2.3%. The prevalence of MDD increased significantly across adolescence, with markedly greater increases among females than among males. Most cases of MDD were associated with psychiatric comorbidity and severe role impairment, and a substantial minority reported suicidality. The prevalence of severe MDD was about one-fourth of that of all MDD cases; estimates of impairment and clinical correlates were of 2- to 5-fold greater magnitude for severe versus mild/moderate depression, with markedly higher rates for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Treatment in any form was received by the majority of adolescents with 12-month DSM-IV MDD (60.4%), but only a minority received treatment that was disorder-specific or from the mental health sector.

295,0,"Major depressive disorder and smoking relapse among adults in the United States: A 10-year, prospective investigation This study investigated the relation between major depressive disorder (MDD) and smoking relapse in the U.S. over a 10-year period. Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Survey Waves I & II. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations between past-year MDD in 1994, past-year MDD in 2005 and persistent depression (1994 and 2005) and risk of smoking relapse in 2005 among former smokers, adjusting for demographics, anxiety disorders, and substance use problems and smoking characteristics. Among former smokers, MDD in 1994, compared to without MDD in 1994, was associated with significantly increased odds of smoking relapse by 2005. Current MDD in 2005 was associated with an even stronger risk of relapse in 2005 and persistent depression even more strongly predicted relapse by 2005. These associations remained significant and were not substantially attenuated by the covariates. In conclusion, MDD appears to confer long-term vulnerability to smoking relapse among adults in the general population. These results suggest interventions for smoking cessation should include screening and treatment for MDD if programs are to be optimally effective at achieving initial quit success as well as enduring abstinence.

Methods We analyzed 5 years of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). We used logistic regressions to study the relationship between MDE and NMPOU among all adolescents, as well as the relationship of MDE with opioid abuse/dependence among adolescents with NMPOU. Other covariates included: sociodemographics, alcohol abuse/dependence, nonopioid drug abuse/dependence, delinquency, school performance, religious services attendance, and family support/supervision. Results In the sample of all adolescents, 6% reported past year NMPOU, and 8% reported past year MDE. When NMPOU and MDE were comorbid, MDE usually preceded the NMPOU. In the sample of adolescents with NMPOU, 15% reported past year opioid abuse/dependence, and 20% reported past year MDE. In adjusted logistic regression, MDE was associated with both NMPOU (OR=1.51, p<0.001) among all adolescents and opioid abuse/dependence (OR=2.18, p<0.001) among adolescents with NMPOU. Conclusion MDE occurs commonly in adolescents and is associated with NMPOU and opioid abuse/dependence. In terms of population attributable risk, which is a function of both the prevalence and the strength of the association, MDE is an important risk factor for NMPOU among adolescents and opioid abuse/dependence among adolescents with NMPOU. Preventive and clinical programs to decrease NMPOU and opioid abuse/dependence among adolescents should consider the prominent role of depression.

298,0,"Patterns of major depression and nonmedical use of prescription opioids in the United States Introduction Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) and major depression frequently co-occur. Comorbid forms of drug use and mental illness such as NMUPO and depression pose a greater disease burden than either condition alone. However, sociodemographic and substance use differences between individuals with either NMUPO or depression and those with comorbid conditions have not yet been fully investigated. Methods Data came from the 2011 and 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Adolescents and adults were examined independently because of differences in screening for major depressive episodes (MDE). Weighted multinomial logistic regression investigated differences between persons with either past-year NMUPO (4.0%) or MDE (5.5%) and those with comorbid NMUPO and MDE (0.6%), compared to persons with neither condition. Results Females were more likely than males to report either MDE-alone and comorbid NMUPO and MDE, whereas adult men were marginally more likely to report NMUPO-alone (not significant among adolescents). Polydrug use and alcohol use disorders were more pronounced among those with comorbid NMUPO and MDE than persons with either NMUPO-alone or MDE-alone. Persons with independent and comorbid NMUPO and MDE were more likely to report lower income and unemployment versus employment. Conclusions This study found that independent and comorbid NMUPO and MDE were disproportionately clustered with burdens of lower socioeconomic position, suggesting that a population-based approach to address NMUPO would target these social determinants of health, whereas a high-risk approach to prevention should be tailored to females experiencing MDE symptoms and polydrug users.

299,0,"Peripheral vascular endothelial growth factor as a novel depression biomarker: A meta-analysis Background The neurotrophic hypothesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) postulates that the pathology of this illness incorporates a down-regulation of neurotrophin signaling. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most studied neurotrophic mediator regarding the neurobiology of MDD. Nevertheless, emerging evidence has implicated the multi-competent angiogenic and neurogenic molecule -- vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -- in hippocampal neurogenesis and depression pathophysiology. Objective To compare peripheral levels of VEGF between individuals with MDD and healthy controls. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of original studies measuring peripheral levels of VEGF in participants with MDD compared to healthy controls. We searched the Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo databases for studies published in any language through December 16th, 2014. Results Fourteen studies met eligibility criteria (N=1633). VEGF levels were significantly elevated in individuals with MDD when compared to healthy controls (Hedges's g=0.343; 95% CI: 0.146--0.540; P<0.01). Funnel plot inspection and the Egger's test did not provide evidence of publication bias. A significant degree of heterogeneity was observed (Q=38.355, df=13, P<0.001; I2=66.1%), which was explored through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Overall methodological quality, sample for assay (plasma versus serum), as well as the matching of MDD and control samples for age and gender emerged as significant sources of heterogeneity. Conclusions Taken together, extant data indicate that VEGF shows promise as a biomarker for MDD, and supports that this mediator may be involved in neuroplasticity mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of MDD.

Method Data were from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Participants meeting criteria for a sub-threshold depressive episode (sMDE; n=3901) reported lifetime depressed mood/loss of interest lasting at least two weeks and at least two of the seven other DSM-IV symptoms of MDD. Predictors of MDE 3 years later were compared in those with and without (n=31022) sMDE. Results Being female, history of alcohol or substance use, and child abuse increased the odds of developing MDD to a greater degree in individuals without sMDE relative to those with sMDE. Among those with sMDE and additional risk factors (low education, substance use), younger age was associated with marginally increased risk of MDD. Conclusion Several demographic risk factors may help identify individuals at risk for developing MDD in individuals who have not experienced an sMDE who may be candidates for early intervention.

Methods Cross sectional study nested in the Regicor Survey. We used a population-based sample of participants 45 years and older (n=5068). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were used to apply DSM-5 criteria to diagnose MDD and BPDs. Results The lifetime prevalence of Single MDD was 4.2% (95% CI=3.7--4.8), while Recurrent MDD was 24.1% (95% CI=22.9--25.3). Other depressive disorders were detected in 0.4% (95% CI=0.2--0.5) of the sample. The lifetime prevalence of a bipolar disorder (BPD) was set to 3.0% (95% CI=2.5--3.4), with 0.3% (95% CI=0.2--0.5) BPD Type I, 0.9% (95% CI=0.6--1.2) BPD type II, and 1.8% (95% CI=1.4--2.1) other BPD. MDD was more frequent in women, unmarried people, and those with low education. BPD rates were higher in young and unmarried people. Limitations Only participants of 45 years and older were included in this study. The length of the depressive episodes was not recorded.

302,0,"Prevalence of major depressive disorder and socio-demographic correlates: Results of a representative household epidemiological survey in Beijing, China Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent mental disorder in the general population and has been associated with socioeconomic factors. Beijing has undergone significant socioeconomic changes in last decade, however no large-scale community epidemiological surveys of MDD have been conducted in Beijing since 2003. Aims To determine the prevalence of MDD and its socio-demographic correlates in a representative household sample of the general population in Beijing, China. Method Data were collected from the 2010 representative household epidemiological survey of mental disorders in Beijing. The multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select qualified subjects in 18 districts and counties, and then face-to-face interviews were administered using the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) during November 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. Results 19,874 registered permanent residents were randomly identified and 16,032 (response rate=80.7%) completed face-to-face interviews. The time-point and life-time prevalence rates of MDD were estimated to be 1.10% (95% CI: 0.94--1.26%) and 3.56% (95% CI: 3.27--3.85%) respectively. Significant differences were found in sex, age, location of residence, marital status, education, employment status, personal/family monthly income, perception of family environment and relationship with others, when comparing residents with MDD to those without MDD. Those who were female, aged 45 or above, reported low family income, or reported an ``average'' or ``poor'' family environment were associated with a higher risk of MDD. Conclusions The prevalence of MDD reported in this survey is relatively lower than that in other western countries. Female sex, age older than 45, low family income, and poor family environment appear to be independent risk factors for MDD.

303,0,"Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor level in elderly women depression: A community-based study Objectives Serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been shown to be lower in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) than in healthy persons. Although several studies have examined the associations between serum BDNF levels and broader categories of depression identified by psychiatrists or depressive symptoms measured with depression scales among nonpatient populations, some of these studies did not consider possible confounders and included mostly young or middle-aged subjects and nonrepresentative control subjects, such as volunteers and patients' relatives. Therefore, it remains unclear that whether MDD, broader categories of depression, or depressive symptoms in the elderly are associated with BDNF. The present study examined these associations in a community sample and controlled for confounders. Methods The subjects were 538 women aged 78 to 88years who had participated in a follow-up survey of a cohort and had scored 24 or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Two depression scales were administered, and, using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, psychiatrists identified 53 persons having any mood disorder (AMD) --- 8 with MDD and 45 with other types of depression according to the DSM-IV or its research criteria --- and 106 healthy controls. Results Subjects with MDD had serum BDNF levels lower than did controls but subjects with AMD did not. The severity of depressive symptoms assessed with either of the 2 depression scales was negatively correlated with serum BDNF levels in all subjects and in subjects remaining after persons with MDD or AMD were excluded. These associations were significant after controlling for possible confounders. Conclusion We have found an association between MDD and serum BDNF levels in old--old women, as has previously been found in younger patients. Although serum BDNF levels were not found to be associated with the broader category of depression, they were associated with depressive symptoms among subjects without clinical depression.

304,0,"Symptom screening scales for detecting major depressive disorder in children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis of reliability, validity and diagnostic utility Background Depression symptom screening scales are often used to determine a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) in prevention research. The aim of this review is to systematically examine the reliability, validity and diagnostic utility of commonly used screening scales in depression prevention research among children and adolescents. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the electronic databases PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA and Medline examining the reliability, validity and diagnostic utility of four commonly used depression symptom rating scales among children and adolescents: the Children׳s Depression Inventory (CDI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Center for Epidemiologic Studies -- Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS). We used univariate and bivariate random effects models to pool data and conducted metaregression to identify and explain causes of heterogeneity. Results We identified 54 studies (66 data points, 34,542 participants). Across the four scales, internal reliability was `good' (pooled estimate: 0.89, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.86--0.92). Sensitivity and specificity were `moderate' (sensitivity: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76--0.84; specificity: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.74--0.83). For studies that used a diagnostic interview to determine a diagnosis of MDD, positive predictive power for identifying true cases was mostly poor. Psychometric properties did not differ on the basis of study quality, sample type (clinical vs. nonclinical) or sample age (child vs. adolescent). Limitations Some analyses may have been underpowered to identify conditions in which test performance may vary, due to low numbers of studies with adequate data. Conclusions Commonly used depression symptom rating scales are reliable measures of depressive symptoms among adolescents; however, using cutoff scores to indicate clinical levels of depression may result in many false positives.

305,0,"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Early Treatment Responses of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in Pediatric Major Depressive Disorder Objective Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line pharmacological treatment for pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD). We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the following: the time-course of response to SSRIs in pediatric depression; whether higher doses of SSRIs are associated with an improved response in pediatric depression; differences in efficacy between SSRI agents; and whether the time-course and magnitude of response to SSRIs is different in pediatric and adult patients with MDD. Method We searched PubMed and CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials comparing SSRIs to placebo for the treatment of pediatric MDD. We extracted weekly symptom data from trials to characterize the trajectory of pharmacological response to SSRIs. Pooled estimates of treatment effect were calculated based on standardized mean differences between treatment and placebo groups. Results The meta-analysis included 13 pediatric MDD trials with a total of 3,004 patients. A logarithmic model indicating that the greatest benefits of SSRIs occurred early in treatment best fit the longitudinal data (log[week] = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.06--0.15, p < .0001). There were no significant differences based on maximum SSRI dose or between particular SSRI agents. SSRIs were demonstrated to have a smaller benefit in pediatric compared to adult MDD. Conclusion Treatment gains in pediatric MDD are greatest early in treatment and are, on average, minimal after 4 weeks of SSRI pharmacotherapy in pediatric MDD. Further research is needed using individual patient data to examine the power of early SSRI response (e.g., 2--4 weeks) to predict outcomes in short-term pharmacological trials.

This study explored the association between cannabis use, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) in a 3-year prospective study. Methods Data was drawn from waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). MDD and BPD were controlled at baseline and defined as meeting full criteria in the 12 months prior to the follow-up. Initiation of cannabis use was defined as any cannabis used by former lifetime abstainers in the time period between baseline and follow-up. Results Cannabis use was not significantly associated with increased incidence of MDD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) for daily use=0.58(0.22--1.51)). Weekly to almost daily cannabis use was associated with increased incidence of BPD ((AOR for weekly to daily use=2.47(1.03--5.92)); daily use was not (AOR=0.52(0.17--1.55)). Baseline MDD was associated with initiation of cannabis use (AOR=1.72(1.1--2.69)). A crude association between baseline BPD and incidence of cannabis use was not maintained in adjusted models (AOR=0.61(0.36--1.04)). Limitations Lack of information regarding frequency of cannabis use at follow-up and limitations regarding generalization of the results. Conclusions Our findings do not support a longitudinal association between cannabis use and incidence of MDD. Results regarding the association between cannabis use and incidence of BPD are conflicting and require further investigation. Baseline MDD, but not BPD, may be associated with future initiation of cannabis use. This may have implications for clinical, social and legislative aspects of cannabis use.

307,0,"The role of adiposity in the relationship between serum leptin and severe major depressive episode Abstract To assess the role that adiposity plays in the association between leptin and major depressive episode (MDE), we analyzed the data of 1046 men and 1359 women aged 20--39 years, who completed an interview and had blood collected as a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1991 and 1994. Waist-hip ratio (WHR) was used as an indicator of adiposity. MDE was assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. For normal-WHR women, the prevalence of MDE was reversely associated with leptin levels, 13.7(4.4)%, 12.2(4.0)% and 2.3(1.8)% respectively for lower, interquartile, and upper quartile. For abnormal-WHR women, the prevalence of MDE was positively associated with leptin, 6.1(2.3)%, 9.1(2.4)% and 20.0 (3.8) respectively for the three leptin levels. Compared to women with lower quartile of leptin, the odds ratio of MDE for women with upper quartile was 0.09 (0.01--0.98) for normal-WHR women but 4.35 (1.55--12.2) for abnormal-WHR women. No moderating effects were observed among men. Using BMI in place of WHR revealed similar findings. The association between MDE and leptin is moderated by adiposity.

Objectives We address the efficacy and safety of tDCS in MDE. Methods The outcome measures were Hedges' g for continuous depression ratings, and categorical response and remission rates. Results A random effects model indicated that tDCS was superior to sham tDCS (k=11, N=393, g=0.30, 95% CI=[0.04, 0.57], p=0.027). Adjunctive antidepressant medication and cognitive control training negatively impacted on the treatment effect. The pooled log odds ratios (LOR) for response and remission were positive, but statistically non-significant (response: k=9, LOR=0.36, 95% CI[−0.16, 0.88], p=0.176, remission: k=9, LOR=0.25, 95% CI [−0.42, 0.91], p=0.468). We estimated that for a study to detect the pooled continuous effect (g=0.30) at 80% power (alpha=0.05), a total N of at least 346 would be required (with the total N required to detect the upper and lower bound being 49 and 12,693, respectively).

309,0,"Development of Critical Embedded Systems Using Model-Driven and Product Lines Techniques: A Systematic Review Several methodologies have been proposed in the last decades to improve the quality of Safety-Critical Embedded Systems (SCES) and, at the same time, keep costs and schedule compatible with project plans. In particular, approaches such as Product Line Engineering (PLE) and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) offer an interesting solution to reduce development complexity and time to market due to their synergy and common goals. However, the current state of how MDE and PLE can be combined to enhance productivity in the domain of SCES is not clear yet. This paper presents a systematic literature review, with the purpose of obtaining the state of the art of the aproaches, methods and methodologies whose goal is the combination of PLE and MDE for the development of SCES, and to verify the existence of empirical studies that demonstrate the application of these techniques in this type of development. We drew the following conclusions from the review results: (1) The number of studies using PLE with MDE to build SCES is relatively small, but has increased gradually in recent years. (2) The approaches diverge about what is needed to build Model-driven Product Lines. (3) Most of the approaches do not consider to differentiate between hardware and software variabilities.

This is important because use cases are commonly used for structuring and documenting requirements while activity diagram used to show the flow of the system. However, this step is less preferred by the developer because writing use cases diagram and activity diagram takes time and it must be done manually. Therefore many developers start to develop automation tools from requirement to behavior diagram. The method used in this research are traceability.

The survey focused also on used modeling languages, processes and tools. A preliminary analysis of the results confirmed that Model-driven engineering, and more in general software modeling, are very relevant phenomena. Approximately 68% of the sample use models during software development. Among then, 44% generate code starting from models and 16% execute them directly.

320,0,"Maturity of software modelling and model driven engineering: A survey in the Italian industry Background: The main claimed advantage of model driven engineering is the improvement of productivity. However, little information is available about its actual usage during software development and maintenance in the industry. Objective: The main aim of this work is investigating the level of maturity in the usage of software models and model driven engineering in the Italian industry. The perspective is that of software engineering researchers. Method: First, we conducted an exploratory personal opinion survey with 155 Italian software professionals. The data were collected with the help of a web-based on-line questionnaire. Then, we conducted focused interviews with three software professionals to interpret doubtful results. Results: Software modelling is a very relevant phenomenon in the Italian industry. Model driven techniques are used in the industry, even if (i) only for a limited extent, (ii) despite a quite generalized dissatisfaction about available tools and (iii) despite a generally low experience of the IT personnel in such techniques. Limitations: Generalization of results is limited due to the sample size. Moreover, possible self-exclusion from participants not interested in modelling could have biased the results.

324,0,"Formalizing standards and regulations variability in longlife projects. A challenge for Model-driven engineering Safety regulations and standards imposed by national regulators on nuclear power plant systems provide high-level requirements, recommendations and/or guidance expressed in natural language. In many cases, this leaves a large margin for interpretation, not all of which are acceptable to a given regulator. Currently the elements that lead to the establishment of acceptable/accepted practices are not always documented, nor are these practices formally modeled. When a new standard appears or when Electricité de France (EDF) has to discuss a standard with another regulator, there is no systematic process to build a practice.

325,0,"Towards Model-Driven Engineering for Big Data Analytics -- An Exploratory Analysis of Domain-Specific Languages for Machine Learning Graphical models and general purpose inference algorithms are powerful tools for moving from imperative towards declarative specification of machine learning problems. Although graphical models define the principle information necessary to adapt inference algorithms to specific probabilistic models, entirely model-driven development is not yet possible. However, generating executable code from graphical models could have several advantages. It could reduce the skills necessary to implement probabilistic models and may speed up development processes. Both advantages address pressing industry needs. They come along with increased supply of data scientist labor, the demand of which cannot be fulfilled at the moment. To explore the opportunities of model-driven big data analytics, I review the main modeling languages used in machine learning as well as inference algorithms and corresponding software implementations. Gaps hampering direct code generation from graphical models are identified and closed by proposing an initial conceptualization of a domain-specific modeling language.

However, despite its merits, MDA remains insufficient for software system development, in the sense that it does not provide a concrete and comprehensive process for governing software development activities. There is therefore a strongly felt need for new model-driven software development methodologies. In this paper we review a number of existing model-driven methodologies, and propose a general framework for model-driven development (MDD) based on MDA.

However, compositional system analysis regarding early Non-Functional Aspects/Properties (NFP) remains difficult.

Despite the great benefits in terms of innovation and in the variety of available solutions, the rapid and continuous growth of the mobile market has resulted in some fragmentation of the platforms that support each mobile device. The existence of different mobile operating systems with different programming languages and development tools can be a problem when someone wants to release an application in as many platforms as possible. The typical approach of simply rewriting the application for each one of those platforms is usually impracticable either in terms of budget or development time, requiring a bigger effort to be made. Therefore, a solution that could generate an application for several platforms (multi or cross-platform) without compromising the overall quality of the application would decrease the time to market of the application and increase enormously the number of potential users.

In particular, the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) standard is used as a starting point for both the natural language specifications and the formal representation. In recent years, SBVR-based approaches have been proposed for transforming natural language business rules into models, such as UML Class Diagrams, however, most focus on the transformations performed after the SBVR models have been created and, therefore, simplify or entirely neglect the natural language to SBVR transformation. There are a number of difficulties in transforming natural language into formal models, such as ambiguity and inconsistency. This paper presents a solution based on a unique combination of techniques from Cognitive Linguistics and Knowledge-based Configuration in order to transform natural language business specifications into SBVR models.

352,0,"Change impact analysis of indirect goal relations: Comparison of NFR and TROPOS approaches based on industrial case study Along with recent trends in using goal-oriented approaches for requirements engineering and system development activities, various techniques for managing adaptable stakeholder goals and requirements are proposed and used by the software engineering industry. Enterprise Architecture (EA) models which tie business goals, business processes and supporting IT systems are also expected to support reasoning on impact of changes on goals and requirements. Unfortunately common Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks like The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and EA modeling languages like Archimate lacks support for analyzing goal and requirement change impacts in EA goal models. This paper reports an effort to fill this gap by extending a metamodel of already existing requirements and goal modeling language. The extension adds semantically reach definitions for goal influence relations that support reasoning on these relations. To leverage existing change impact analysis techniques, a literature review was conducted on existing goal change management techniques. Two candidate approaches (TROPOS and NFR framework) were chosen from the review results based on comparative analysis study. However, there is no evidence suggesting which of these two approaches suits more for EA goal model analysis. To find empirical evidence on the applicability of these approaches, we develop an adapted algorithm as well as a tool support for both techniques and apply both approaches on an industrial case study. Two main lessons were learned from the result of the case study. First both approaches have some limitations when applied to EA goal analysis and second, the NFR/Fuzzy logic based approaches provide more concrete results than the TROPOS based approaches. business data processing, DP industry, formal specification, fuzzy logic, management of change, change impact analysis, indirect goal relations, NFR framework, TROPOS framework, requirements engineering, system development activities, adaptable stakeholder goal management, adaptable stakeholder requirements management, software engineering industry, enterprise architecture models, business goals, business processes, IT systems, the open group architecture framework, EA modeling languages, Archimate, requirements modeling language, goal modeling language, goal change management techniques, EA goal analysis, fuzzy logic based approaches, Fuzzy logic, Business, Cognition, Analytical models, Context, Fuzzy sets, Computer architecture, goal change management, goal reasoning, indirect influence relations, enterprise architecture",change impact analysis of indirect goal relations comparison of nfr and tropos approaches based on industrial case study along with recent trends in using goal oriented approaches for requirements engineering and system development activities various techniques for managing adaptable stakeholder goals and requirements are proposed and used by the software engineering industry enterprise architecture ea models which tie business goals business processes and supporting it systems are also expected to support reasoning on impact of changes on goals and requirements unfortunately common enterprise architecture ea frameworks like the open group architecture framework togaf and ea modeling languages like archimate lacks support for analyzing goal and requirement change impacts in ea goal models this paper reports an effort to fill this gap by extending a metamodel of already existing requirements and goal modeling language the extension adds semantically reach definitions for goal influence relations that support reasoning on these relations to leverage existing change impact analysis techniques a literature review was conducted on existing goal change management techniques two candidate approaches tropos and nfr framework were chosen from the review results based on comparative analysis study however there is no evidence suggesting which of these two approaches suits more for ea goal model analysis to find empirical evidence on the applicability of these approaches we develop an adapted algorithm as well as a tool support for both techniques and apply both approaches on an industrial case study two main lessons were learned from the result of the case study first both approaches have some limitations when applied to ea goal analysis and second the nfr fuzzy logic based approaches provide more concrete results than the tropos based approaches business data processing dp industry formal specification fuzzy logic management of change change impact analysis indirect goal relations nfr framework tropos framework requirements engineering system development activities adaptable stakeholder goal management adaptable stakeholder requirements management software engineering industry enterprise architecture models business goals business processes it systems the open group architecture framework ea modeling languages archimate requirements modeling language goal modeling language goal change management techniques ea goal analysis fuzzy logic based approaches fuzzy logic business cognition analytical models context fuzzy sets computer architecture goal change management goal reasoning indirect influence relations enterprise architecture,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

Furthermore this complexity is augmented by the fact that supporting service creation environments are technology-specific. Consequently a technology-independent approach and framework are required to generate service creation environments and drive service creation. In this paper we present such an approach and a generic framework for supporting service creation. The approach realizes service creation via the phases of: (i) domain specific language definition, (ii) model definition and validation, (iii) model-to-model transformation and (iv) model-to-code generation. Each phase maps to a corresponding phase in service creation starting from service analysis to service implementation.

For some time, the greatest attention of Model-Based Testing (MBT) research has focused on functional aspects. The only exception is represented by the UML Testing Profile (UML-TP) that is a lightweight extension of UML to support the design of testing artifacts, but it only provides limited support for non-functional testing. In this paper we provide a first attempt to extend UML-TP for improving the design of non-functional tests. The proposed extension deals with some important concepts of non-functional testing such as the workload and the global verdicts.

357,0,"Validating the functional design of embedded systems against stakeholder intentions In the embedded systems industry, function-centered engineering is commonly applied to address the increasing number and complexity of system functions. During function-centered engineering, the functional design that is created based on the defined requirements for the system is the main artifact that serves as a basis for subsequent development activities. If stakeholder intentions change and modifications become necessary, they are frequently incorporated directly into the functional design without updating the behavioral requirements accordingly. As a consequence, the correctness of the interplay of system functions as defined in the functional design cannot be assessed by checking it against the defined requirements (since they are outdated) but needs to be checked against the current stakeholder intentions. More precisely, the requirements engineer has to validate the functional design against the stakeholder intentions because he is the expert concerning the stakeholder intentions and can communicate with the stakeholders regarding them, if necessary. However, the requirements engineer is typically not familiar with the functional design and its notation on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the overall behavior of the system is spread across various diagrams in the functional design. Therefore, the requirements engineer needs a more abstract and consolidated view of the functional design in order to be able to validate its correctness with regard to the current stakeholder intentions. In this paper, we present an approach which is based on a specific kind of review model that is automatically generated from the functional design and supports the requirements engineer in her task.

ICCD established different catalogue datasheets for each typology of Cultural Good, providing also detailed instructions to fill them. However, the computer assisted process necessary to the management of these complex datasheets (in some cases up to nearly 500 fields) is inadequate. TekneHub carried out a survey at Italian Museums and Soprintendenze ai beni storici, artistici ed etnoantropologici to analyse problems and needs through all the steps of the cataloging activity, thus drawing a precise picture of the issues to be addressed. Fhoster, an Italian hi-tech startup specialized in model-driven Application Platform as a Service (APaaS), offered its flagship platform, called Livebase, to support the research. Livebase is a cloud-computing service integrating an environment to quickly design custom applications and a hosting environment to immediately deploy such applications. Livebase can be accessed and used by authenticated users via a simple web browser. The unique model-driven approach of the Livebase platform allowed Fhoster and TekneHub to quickly test many alternative designs to match the ICCD datasheet chosen as a test (Naturalistic Palaeontological Goods - form BNP 3.01), and to implement specific functions to facilitate the cataloguing activity. As a test bed, the Geological Museum ``Capellini'' offered all the paper entry catalogue of its collection of fossil fish from the Middle Eocene of Bolca (Vicenza, Italy).

In this paper we provide a brief overview of research on structural metadata extraction in the DARPA EARS rich transcription program. Tasks include detection of sentence boundaries, filler words, and disfluencies. Modeling approaches combine lexical, prosodic, and syntactic information, using various modeling techniques for knowledge source integration. The performance of these methods is evaluated by task, by data source (broadcast news versus spontaneous telephone conversations) and by whether transcriptions come from humans or from an (errorful) automatic speech recognizer. A representative sample of results shows that combining multiple knowledge sources (words, prosody, syntactic information) is helpful, that prosody is more helpful for news speech than for conversational speech, that word errors significantly impact performance, and that discriminative models generally provide benefit over maximum likelihood models.

361,0,"Components in model-based software development Model-based software development (MBSD) is rapidly gaining popularity. There are two main approaches to MBSD: transformational and compositional approaches. The first has been initiated in nineties by creating UML - a universal modeling language that has become a standard for software specification, and has influenced research in software engineering.

362,0,"Analysis as a First-Class Citizen: An Application to Architecture Description Languages Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) support modeling and analysis of systems through models transformation and exploration. Various contributions made proposals to bring verification capabilities to designers through model-based frame-works and illustrated benefits to the overall system quality. Model-level analyses are usually performed as an exogenous, unidirectional and semantically weak transformation towards a third-party model. We claim such process can be incomplete and/or inefficient because gathered results lead to evolution of the primary model. This is particularly problematic for the design of Distributed Real-Time Embedded (DRE) systems that has to tackle many concerns like time, security or safety. In this paper, we argue why analysis should no longer be considered as a side step in the design process but, rather, should be embedded as a first-class citizen in the model itself. We review several standardized architecture description languages, which consider analysis as a goal. As an element of solution, we introduce current work on the definition of a language dedicated to the analysis of models within the scope of one particular ADL, namely the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL). embedded systems, formal verification, software architecture, specification languages, first-class citizen, models transformation, models exploration, verification capability, model-based frameworks, system quality, model-level analysis, distributed real-time embedded system, DRE system, design process, standardized architecture description languages, architecture analysis and design language, AADL, Analytical models, Unified modeling language, Computational modeling, Computer architecture, Real-time systems, Software, Context modeling, MDE, Analysis, V&V, AADL, ACL",analysis as a first class citizen an application to architecture description languages architecture description languages adls support modeling and analysis of systems through models transformation and exploration various contributions made proposals to bring verification capabilities to designers through model based frame works and illustrated benefits to the overall system quality model level analyses are usually performed as an exogenous unidirectional and semantically weak transformation towards a third party model we claim such process can be incomplete and or inefficient because gathered results lead to evolution of the primary model this is particularly problematic for the design of distributed real time embedded dre systems that has to tackle many concerns like time security or safety in this paper we argue why analysis should no longer be considered as a side step in the design process but rather should be embedded as a first class citizen in the model itself we review several standardized architecture description languages which consider analysis as a goal as an element of solution we introduce current work on the definition of a language dedicated to the analysis of models within the scope of one particular adl namely the architecture analysis and design language aadl embedded systems formal verification software architecture specification languages first class citizen models transformation models exploration verification capability model based frameworks system quality model level analysis distributed real time embedded system dre system design process standardized architecture description languages architecture analysis and design language aadl analytical models unified modeling language computational modeling computer architecture real time systems software context modeling mde analysis v v aadl acl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

We started this research by providing a comprehensive review and description of the QoS specifications that comprise some already existing factors contributing to the QoS and some newly proposed ones. These include the availability, accessibility, reliability, integrity, the response time of the service, security, performance, etc. Hence, the aim of this research is two folds, first, it helps the designers and developers to provide better web services and second, and it helps ensure consistent software architecture as a reference model for many applications. To achieve this, we model, first, the meta-QoS model of the Web services. Then, we formalize the QoS of the Web services by referring to ARMANI which provides a language of predicates that is powerful enough to reconcile any mismatches and, thus, provide a reliable composition of the Web services.

368,0,"Comparing State- and Operation-Based Change Tracking on Models In recent years, models are increasingly used throughout the entire lifecycle in software development projects. In effect, the need for collaborating on these models emerged, requiring change tracking and versioning. However, many researchers have shown that existing methods and tools for Version Control (VC) do not work well on graph-like models, such as UML, SysML or domain-specific modeling languages. To alleviate this, alternative techniques and methods have been proposed which can be classified into state-based and operation-based approaches. Existing research shows advantages of operation-based over state-based approaches in selected use cases, such as conflict detection or merging. However, there are only few results available on the advantages of operation-based approaches in the most common use case of a VC system: review and understand change. In this paper, we present and discuss both approaches and their use cases. Moreover, we present the results of an empirical study to compare a state-based with an operation-based approach for the use case of reviewing and understanding change.

371,0,"Modeling Human Judgment of Digital Imagery for Multimedia Retrieval The application of machine learning techniques to image and video search has been shown to boost the performance of multimedia retrieval systems, and promises to lead to more generalized semantic search approaches. In particular, the availability of large training collections allows model-driven search using a substantial number of semantic concepts. The training collections are obtained in a manual annotation process where human raters review images and assign predefined semantic concept labels. Besides being prone to human error, manual image annotation is biased by the view of the individual annotator because visual information almost always leaves room for ambiguity. Ideally, several independent judgments are obtained per image, and the inter-rater agreement is assessed. While disagreement between ratings bears valuable information on the annotation quality, it complicates the task of clearly classifying rated images based on multiple judgments. In the absence of a gold standard, evaluating multiple judgments and resolving disagreement between raters is not trivial. In this paper, we present an approach using latent structure analysis to solve this problem. We apply latent class modeling to the annotation data collected during the TRECVID 2005 Annotation Forum, and demonstrate how to use this statistic to clearly classify each image on the basis of varying numbers of ratings.

Thus, interactive applications can be developed seamlessly.

374,0,"Analysis of Multimodal Neuroimaging Data Each method for imaging brain activity has technical or physiological limits. Thus, combinations of neuroimaging modalities that can alleviate these limitations such as simultaneous recordings of neurophysiological and hemodynamic activity have become increasingly popular. Multimodal imaging setups can take advantage of complementary views on neural activity and enhance our understanding about how neural information processing is reflected in each modality. However, dedicated analysis methods are needed to exploit the potential of multimodal methods. Many solutions to this data integration problem have been proposed, which often renders both comparisons of results and the choice of the right method for the data at hand difficult. In this review we will discuss different multimodal neuroimaging setups, the advances achieved in basic research and clinical application and the methods used. We will provide a comprehensive overview of mathematical tools reoccurring in multimodal neuroimaging studies for artifact removal, data-driven and model-driven analyses, enabling the practitioner to try established or new combinations from these algorithmic building blocks. biomedical imaging, brain, data analysis, data integration, haemodynamics, neurophysiology, multimodal neuroimaging data analysis, brain activity, clinical application, mathematical tool, artifact removal, model-driven analysis, data-driven analysis, hemodynamic activity, neurophysiological activity, data integration, Biomedical imaging, Neuroimaging, Spatial resolution, Brain modeling, Electrophysiology, Hemodynamics, Electroencephalography, Electroencephalograms (EEG), EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fMRI, magnetoencephalograms (MEG), MEG-fMRI, multimodal, neuroimaging, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), Brain, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Electroencephalography, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetoencephalography, Optics and Photonics, Positron-Emission Tomography, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data each method for imaging brain activity has technical or physiological limits thus combinations of neuroimaging modalities that can alleviate these limitations such as simultaneous recordings of neurophysiological and hemodynamic activity have become increasingly popular multimodal imaging setups can take advantage of complementary views on neural activity and enhance our understanding about how neural information processing is reflected in each modality however dedicated analysis methods are needed to exploit the potential of multimodal methods many solutions to this data integration problem have been proposed which often renders both comparisons of results and the choice of the right method for the data at hand difficult in this review we will discuss different multimodal neuroimaging setups the advances achieved in basic research and clinical application and the methods used we will provide a comprehensive overview of mathematical tools reoccurring in multimodal neuroimaging studies for artifact removal data driven and model driven analyses enabling the practitioner to try established or new combinations from these algorithmic building blocks biomedical imaging brain data analysis data integration haemodynamics neurophysiology multimodal neuroimaging data analysis brain activity clinical application mathematical tool artifact removal model driven analysis data driven analysis hemodynamic activity neurophysiological activity data integration biomedical imaging neuroimaging spatial resolution brain modeling electrophysiology hemodynamics electroencephalography electroencephalograms eeg eeg functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri fmri magnetoencephalograms meg meg fmri multimodal neuroimaging near infrared spectroscopy nirs brain diffusion tensor imaging electroencephalography humans image processing computer assisted magnetic resonance imaging magnetoencephalography optics and photonics positron emission tomography spectroscopy near infrared,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

The extent of traceability practice is viewed as a measure of system quality and process maturity and is mandated by many standards. This paper introduces model traceability, reviews the current state of the art, and highlights open problems. One issue that impedes wide adoption of traceability is the overhead incurred in manually creating and maintaining relationships. We review the latest research advancements that address this issue through the automatic discovery of trace relationships. Model driven development provides new opportunities for establishing and using traceability information. We discuss automatic generation of trace information through transformations and the use of traceability relationships to maintain consistency and synchronize model artifacts.

380,0,"What value does money play in the motivation of `knowledge workers' such as Project Managers Much of the current research into motivation and performance list things areas such as task variety and work autonomy as the main constituents and money is reduced to a hygiene factor in employee performance. However much of this conventional research has been carried out in the retail and manufacturing industries where much of the work is repetitive. How does this model fit for the new developing areas of professionals classed as 'knowledge workers', to which the profession of project management belongs where task variety and a high level of work autonomy already exists. This paper looks at one aspect of the survey carried out across the Consulting Business Group, Halcrow Group Ltd that of how the recognition scheme was perceived after its introduction by members. There is much evidence that contingently administered recognition schemes can be as powerful a reinforcement to increase employee performance as a part of a total reward model. Driven by this proposition, Consulting Business Group has been carrying out a pilot recognition scheme across all its 523 staff, over a 6 month period from April to September 2005, predominantly targeted at the staff in the UK and this report deals with the feedback from those staff and the underlying implications for knowledge workers such as project managers. We received 281 responses (Total staff number of 523) from 27 offices worldwide representing a return of 54% which means that the results of this survey are statistically relevant and can be said to represent the opinions of the business group. The overriding factor was that only 3% of this group of staff would be against us continuing this scheme and believe, despite the variety of viewpoints, philosophies and concerns, that it is a worthwhile initiative. However where the most interesting discrepancy was the way in which money was viewed rather than as a hygiene factor that the research had indicated it appeared to be a 'badge of status with implications for self-esteem and exercise of influence and directly related to work effort and job satisfaction. In fact they appear to use pay as a means of evaluating their net worth to both the organisation and the external labour market checking constantly for discrepancies between the two. human resource management, incentive schemes, labour resources, manufacturing industries, organisational aspects, personnel, project management, retailing, salaries, motivation, knowledge workers, project managers, employee performance, retailing, manufacturing industries, project management, Halcrow Group Limited, Consulting Business Group, UK, job satisfaction, organisation, external labour market, Financial management, Knowledge management, Project management, Business, Contingency management, Energy management, Research and development management, Power system management, Road transportation, Manufacturing",what value does money play in the motivation of knowledge workers such as project managers much of the current research into motivation and performance list things areas such as task variety and work autonomy as the main constituents and money is reduced to a hygiene factor in employee performance however much of this conventional research has been carried out in the retail and manufacturing industries where much of the work is repetitive how does this model fit for the new developing areas of professionals classed as knowledge workers to which the profession of project management belongs where task variety and a high level of work autonomy already exists this paper looks at one aspect of the survey carried out across the consulting business group halcrow group ltd that of how the recognition scheme was perceived after its introduction by members there is much evidence that contingently administered recognition schemes can be as powerful a reinforcement to increase employee performance as a part of a total reward model driven by this proposition consulting business group has been carrying out a pilot recognition scheme across all its 523 staff over a 6 month period from april to september 2005 predominantly targeted at the staff in the uk and this report deals with the feedback from those staff and the underlying implications for knowledge workers such as project managers we received 281 responses total staff number of 523 from 27 offices worldwide representing a return of 54 which means that the results of this survey are statistically relevant and can be said to represent the opinions of the business group the overriding factor was that only 3 of this group of staff would be against us continuing this scheme and believe despite the variety of viewpoints philosophies and concerns that it is a worthwhile initiative however where the most interesting discrepancy was the way in which money was viewed rather than as a hygiene factor that the research had indicated it appeared to be a badge of status with implications for self esteem and exercise of influence and directly related to work effort and job satisfaction in fact they appear to use pay as a means of evaluating their net worth to both the organisation and the external labour market checking constantly for discrepancies between the two human resource management incentive schemes labour resources manufacturing industries organisational aspects personnel project management retailing salaries motivation knowledge workers project managers employee performance retailing manufacturing industries project management halcrow group limited consulting business group uk job satisfaction organisation external labour market financial management knowledge management project management business contingency management energy management research and development management power system management road transportation manufacturing,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

Students homework and tests during the semester are done interactively with PIT, giving tutors the time to assist students and not only to review their homework and tests. Hence, there are two substantial benefits: A more effective education and support for the students and a reduction of the costs for the institute.

The original contribution of this paper to existing knowledge on the development of operational automatic remote sensing image understanding systems (RS-IUSs) is fourfold. First, existing RS-IUS architectures are critically revised. In this review section, the two-stage stratified hierarchical RS-IUS model, originally proposed by Shackelford and Davis, is identified as a subclass of the parent class of multiagent hybrid systems for RS image understanding, which is potentially superior to the two-stage segment-based RS-IUS architecture that is currently considered the state-of-the-art in commercial RS image-processing software toolboxes. Second, this paper highlights the degree of novelty of an operational automatic near-real-time well-posed model-driven application-independent per-pixel Landsat-like spectral-rule-based decision-tree classifier (LSRC) recently presented in RS literature. Third, five original downscaled implementations of the LSRC system are proposed to be input with a multispectral image whose spectral resolution overlaps with, but is inferior to, Landsat's. These five downscaled LSRC implementations are identified as the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre-like SRC, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-like SRC, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer-like SRC, the IKONOS-like SRC, and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation-like SRC, respectively.

In real-time systems, quantitative values of time, as reflected through the duration of actions, are central to the system's correctness. We review basic time concepts and explain how time is handled in different modeling languages. We expose the inherent paradox of incorporating quantitative time-dependent behavior in high-level models. High-level models are typically built before the system is implemented, which makes quantitative time metrics difficult to predict since these metrics depend heavily on implementation details. We provide some possible answers to this paradox and explain how the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language helps address some of these issues. programming languages, real-time systems, specification languages, systems engineering, hardware system, software system, system engineering, real-time system, modeling language, high-level model, Timed Abstract State Machine language, Hardware, Software systems, Real time systems, Timing, Systems engineering and theory, Physics, Temperature, Embedded system, Laboratories, Predictive models",incorporating time in the modeling of hardware and software systems concepts paradigms and paradoxes in this paper we present some of the issues encountered when trying to apply model driven approaches to the engineering of real time systems in real time systems quantitative values of time as reflected through the duration of actions are central to the system s correctness we review basic time concepts and explain how time is handled in different modeling languages we expose the inherent paradox of incorporating quantitative time dependent behavior in high level models high level models are typically built before the system is implemented which makes quantitative time metrics difficult to predict since these metrics depend heavily on implementation details we provide some possible answers to this paradox and explain how the timed abstract state machine tasm language helps address some of these issues programming languages real time systems specification languages systems engineering hardware system software system system engineering real time system modeling language high level model timed abstract state machine language hardware software systems real time systems timing systems engineering and theory physics temperature embedded system laboratories predictive models,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0

As various kinds of systems can be used to implement service-oriented architectures, the recent trend is to apply principles of model-driven development by (i) modeling the service-oriented architecture in an abstract manner and (ii) providing model transformations between this abstract specification and the underlying platform specific systems. As such, multiagent systems became very popular as both, service-oriented architectures and multiagent systems, share several commonalities. In this paper, we compare the core building blocks of multiagent systems and the emerging UPMS (UML profile and metamodel) standard for service-oriented architectures from the Object Management Group (OMG).

To build a software system, a sequence of transformations is performed, starting from requirements and ending with implementation. However, requirements are mostly in the form of text, but not a model that can be easily understood by computers; therefore, automated transformations from requirements to analysis models are not easy to achieve. The overall objective of this systematic review is to examine existing literature works that transform textual requirements into analysis models, highlight open issues, and provide suggestions on potential directions of future research. The systematic review led to the analysis of 20 primary studies (16 approaches) obtained after a carefully designed procedure for selecting papers published in journals and conferences from 1996 to 2008 and Software Engineering textbooks.

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) further increases the importance of models, as in MDE models are not only used for documentation and communication, but as central artefacts of the software development process. Various recent research approaches take the idea of using models as central artefacts one step further by using models at runtime to cope with dynamic aspects of ever-changing software and its environment.

MDS aims at improving the productivity of the development process and quality of the resulting secure systems, with models as the main artifact.

The systematic review process, which is based on a formally designed review protocol, allowed us to identify, classify, and evaluate different MDS approaches. To be more specific, from thousands of relevant papers found, a final set of the most relevant MDS publications has been identified, strictly selected, and reviewed. We present a taxonomy for MDS, which is used to synthesize data in order to classify and evaluate the selected MDS approaches.

397,1,"A systematic review of UML model consistency management Information System (IS) development has been beset by consistency problems since its infancy. These problems are greater still in UML software development, and are principally caused by the existence of multiple views (models) for the same system, and may involve potentially contradictory system specifications. Since a considerable amount of work takes place within the scope of model consistency management, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) which was carried out to discover the various current model consistency conceptions, proposals, problems and solutions provided. To do this, a total of 907 papers related to UML model consistency published in literature and extracted from the most relevant scientific sources (IEEE Computer Society, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and the SCOPUS Database) were considered, of which 42 papers were eventually analyzed. This systematic literature review resulted in the identification of the current state-of-the-art with regard to UML model consistency management research along with open issues, trends and future research within this scope.

This paper presents a systematic review of the current use of requirements engineering techniques in MDD processes and their actual automation level. 72 papers from the last decade have been reviewed from an initial set of 884 papers. The results show that although MDD techniques are used to a great extent in platform-independent models, platform-specific models, and at code level, at the requirements level most MDD approaches use only partially defined requirements models or even natural language.

401,1,"Formal verification of static software models in MDE: A systematic review Context Model-driven Engineering (MDE) promotes the utilization of models as primary artifacts in all software engineering activities. Therefore, mechanisms to ensure model correctness become crucial, specially when applying MDE to the development of software, where software is the result of a chain of (semi)automatic model transformations that refine initial abstract models to lower level ones from which the final code is eventually generated. Clearly, in this context, an error in the model/s is propagated to the code endangering the soundness of the resulting software. Formal verification of software models is a promising approach that advocates the employment of formal methods to achieve model correctness, and it has received a considerable amount of attention in the last few years. Objective The objective of this paper is to analyze the state of the art in the field of formal verification of models, restricting the analysis to those approaches applied over static software models complemented or not with constraints expressed in textual languages, typically the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Method We have conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the published works in this field, describing their main characteristics. Results The study is based on a set of 48 resources that have been grouped in 18 different approaches according to their affinity. For each of them we have analyzed, among other issues, the formalism used, the support given to OCL, the correctness properties addressed or the feedback yielded by the verification process. Conclusions One of the most important conclusions obtained is that current model verification approaches are strongly influenced by the support given to OCL. Another important finding is that in general, current verification tools present important flaws like the lack of integration into the model designer tool chain or the lack of efficiency when verifying large, real-life models.

Six digital libraries were searched, and 266 papers dealing specifically with the quality of UML models were identified and classified into five dimensions: type of model quality, type of evidence, type of research result, type of diagram, and research goal. The results indicate that most research focuses on semantic quality, with relatively little on semantic completeness; as such, this research examines new modeling methods vs. quality frameworks and metrics, as well as quality assurance vs. understanding quality issues.

406,1,"A systematic review of code generation proposals from state machine specifications Context Model Driven Development (MDD) encourages the use of models for developing complex software systems. Following a MDD approach, modelling languages are used to diagrammatically model the structure and behaviour of object-oriented software, among which state-based languages (including UML state machines, finite state machines and Harel statecharts) constitute the most widely used to specify the dynamic behaviour of a system. However, generating code from state machine models as part of the final system constitutes one of the most challenging tasks due to its dynamic nature and because many state machine concepts are not supported by the object-oriented programming languages. Therefore, it is not surprising that such code generation has received great attention over the years. Objective The overall objective of this paper is to plot the landscape of published proposals in the field of object oriented code generation from state machine specifications, restricting the search neither to a specific context nor to a particular programming language. Method We perform a systematic, accurate literature review of published studies focusing on the object oriented implementation of state machine specifications. Results The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 53 resources in all, which we have classified into two groups: pattern-based and not pattern-based. For each proposal, we have analysed both the state machine specification elements they support and the means the authors propose for their implementation. Additionally, the review investigates which proposals take into account desirable features to be considered in software development such as maintenance or reusability. Conclusions One of the conclusions drawn from the review is that most of the analysed works are based on a software design pattern. Another key finding is that many papers neither support several of the main components of the expressive richness of state machine specifications nor provide an implementation strategy that considers relevant qualitative aspects in software development.

New paradigms have appeared to support this vision: Business Process Management (BPM), Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) and Model-Driven Development (MDD). BPM deals with managing business process lifecycle from modeling, implementation, execution and evaluation to find improvement opportunities. SOC bases the design and implementation of software on services, which are defined to support business processes. MDD focus is on models, allowing the definition of automatic transformation between them along with code generation for different platforms.
