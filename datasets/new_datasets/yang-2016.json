    "title" : "A systematic mapping study on the combination of software architecture and agile development", 
    "abstract" : "Context
    Combining software architecture and agile development has received significant attention in recent years. However, there exists no comprehensive overview of the state of research on the architecture-agility combination.
    
    Objective
    This work aims to analyze the combination of architecture and agile methods for the purpose of exploration and analysis with respect to architecting activities and approaches, agile methods and practices, costs, benefits, challenges, factors, tools, and lessons learned concerning the combination.
    
    Method
    A systematic mapping study (SMS) was conducted, covering the literature on the architecture-agility combination published between February 2001 and January 2014.
    
    Results
    Fifty-four studies were finally included in this SMS. Some of the highlights: (1) a significant difference exists in the proportion of various architecting activities, agile methods, and agile practices employed in the combination. (2) none of the architecting approaches has been widely used in the combination. (3) there is a lack of description and analysis regarding the costs and failure stories of the combination. (4) twenty challenges, twenty-nine factors, and twenty-five lessons learned were identified.
    
    Conclusions
    The results of this SMS help the software engineering community to reflect on the past thirteen years of research and practice on the architecture-agility combination with a number of implications.",

            "explanation" : "There are obstacles (conflicts) in combining agile methods and architecture, e.g., SA implicitly follows a top-down development process while agility represents a bottom-up development and delivery of new features. These challenges can provide research directions for improving the architecture-agility combination."

            "explanation" : "Whether an architecture-agility combination is successful or not may be impacted by certain factors (e.g. contextual factors) in software development. Note that Chen and Babar identified the contextual factors that impact architecture emergence in agile development ([Chen and Babar, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121215002125?via%3Dihub#bib0020)). Our SMS covers those contextual factors as well as other factors that impact the success of applying the architecture-agility combination. From this perspective, our study has a different focus and a larger scope compared with the study by Chen and Babar ([Chen and Babar, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121215002125?via%3Dihub#bib0020))."
